court erred in refusing to grant him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under u.s.s.g. 3e1.1(a) . he contends that he manifested acceptance of responsibility by admitting his involvement in the offense, showing remorse, and cooperating with law enforcement officials. the government responds that the district court's finding that charo had not accepted responsibility for the offense conduct was not clearly erroneous. the sentencing court's determination that a defendant is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is entitled to great deference and will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. united states v. spraggins , 868 f.2d 1541, 1543 (11th cir.1989). section 3e1.1(a) requires a sentencing court to reduce the offense level by two levels \"\"if the defendant clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\"\" in determining whether defendant qualifies for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment, the sentencing court may consider whether the defendant made a \"\"voluntary and truthful admission to authorities of involvement in the offense and related conduct.\"\" u.s.s.g. 3e1.1 , comment. (n. 1(c)). charo pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and one count of money laundering. at the change of plea hearing, he admitted that from june through october of 1981, he transported cocaine base from houston, texas to mobile, alabama on several occasions. he further admitted that he transported approximately one-half a kilogram at a time. charo told the probation officer that he transported approximately one and one-half kilograms of cocaine base on four occasions. thus, the probation officer estimated that he transported four kilograms of cocaine base. at sentencing, he admitted to transporting a total of one and one-half kilograms of cocaine base. charo's statement was not a truthful admission and did not show a clear acceptance of responsibility. the court, therefore, did not err in declining to grant a two-level reduction. the sentence and judgment are affirm

00:00:00</td><td>1.6631805166380147  </td><td>logan , circuit judge. the only issue in this appeal is whether a new mexico state conviction for conspiracy to commit a violent felony is a conviction of a violent felony for purposes of the sentence enhancement provisions of 18 u.s.c. 924(e) . we hold that it is not, and therefore affirm the district court's judgment to that effect. after a jury trial, defendant algie king was convicted of being a previously convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 u.s.c. 922(g) . section 924(e)(1) of the same title provides for a mandatory enhanced penalty of not less than fifteen years imprisonment for defendant if he \"\"has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\"\" in this case, defendant's criminal history included new mexico state court convictions for involuntary manslaughter and for aggravated battery, both conceded to be \"\"violent felonies,\"\" and for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. 1 the district court refused to accord the conspiracy conviction \"\"violent felony\"\" status for purposes of 924(e) , finding that the elements required to prove a conspiracy in new mexico--that the defendant and another person agreed together to commit an offense and that they intended to commit that offense--did not meet the statutory definition. see n.m. unif. jury instr.--criminal, no. 14-2810 (michie 1986). the government has appealed. the definition of \"\"violent felony\"\" for purposes of 18 u.s.c. 924 is as follows: id . 924(e)(2) (b). because the issue is one of statutory interpretation, we review the district court's judgment de novo. united states v. maines , 920 f.2d 1525, 1527 n. 4 (10th cir.1990), cert. denied , u.s. , 112 s.ct. 263 , 116 l.ed.2d 216 (1991). for purposes of 924(e) , the courts do not inquire into the particular factual circumstances surrounding the past offenses. we look \"\"only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\"\" taylor v. united states , 495 u.s. 575, 602 , 110 s.ct. 2143, 2160 , 109 l.ed.2d 607 (1990). this formal categorical approach was mandated by the supreme court to avoid \"\"the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach\"\" to each prior conviction. id. at 601 , 110 s.ct. at 2159 . the only appellate decision to have considered a conspiracy conviction under 924(e)(2) (b) is united states v. preston , 910 f.2d 81 (3d cir.1990), cert. denied , u.s. , 111 s.ct. 1002 , 112 l.ed.2d 1085 (1991). there the court ruled that the defendant's pennsylvania state court conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery was indeed a \"\"violent felony\"\" under 924(e) for sentence enhancement purposes. the court reasoned that \"\"pennsylvania law requires that the crime that was the object of the conspiracy be defined for the jury. thus, the elements of criminal conspiracy to commit robbery subsume the elements of robbery, which is a violent felony for purposes of 924(e) .\"\" id. at 86 (footnote omitted). the court held that a conviction for conspiracy to commit a violent felony fell within the first of the two alternative definitions: that it \"\"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\" 18 u.s.c. 924(e)(2)(b)(i) . although the third circuit's interpretation may be proper under pennsylvania law, we think that it is not a proper construction as applied to new mexico law. to convict a defendant of conspiracy in new mexico, the state must prove that the defendant and another person agreed together to commit a felony and that they intended to commit the felony. although the crime forming the basis of the conspiracy must be explained to the jury, new mexico law is clear that \"\"[t]he overt act which constitutes the object of the conspiracy is no part of the crime of conspiracy; indeed, an overt act is not required, but the crime is complete when the felonious agreement is reached.\"\" state v. leyba , 93 n.m. 366, 367 , 600 p.2d 312, 313 (1979); see also state v. jacobs , 102 n.m. 801, 805 , 701 p.2d 400, 404 (1985) (\"\"it makes no difference to the conspiracy charge whether an aggravated burglary was proved or whether that charge was dismissed. the proof required was of an agreement to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means. \"\"); state v. gilbert , 98 n.m. 77, 81 , 644 p.2d 1066, 1070 (1982) (\"\"it is the agreement constituting the conspiracy which the statute punishes.\"\"). consequently, the elements of the felonious object of the conspiracy are not subsumed within the elements of the conspiracy charge itself. therefore, if a conspiracy to commit armed robbery is to be deemed a \"\"violent felony\"\" under 924(e)(2) (b)(i), it must be on the basis of the elements of the conspiracy charge, not the underlying substantive offense. we thus consider whether a conspiracy charge \"\"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\" id. clearly neither actual nor attempted use of force is required for conviction under conspiracy law; the object of conspiracy statutes is to make it unnecessary for law enforcement officials to wait for such acts to occur before intervening. whether the intent to commit a violent felony constitutes a \"\"threatened use of physical force\"\" is more problematic. read broadly, the formed intent of the conspirators does constitute a inchoate \"\"threat\"\" to both the impending target of the contemplated felony and to society as a whole. in this context, however, \"\"threatened use of physical force\"\" means both an intent to use force and a communication of that intent. cf. black's law dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \"\"threat\"\" as \"\"[a] communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm on any person or on property\"\"). because the crime of conspiracy in new mexico is complete upon the formation of the intent to commit a felony, and does not require that any action be taken on that intent, the elements of a conspiracy to commit a violent felony do not include the threatened use of physical force. we therefore hold that a conspiracy conviction does not qualify as a \"\"violent felony\"\" under the first statutory definition of 924(e)(2) (b)(i). the second statutory definition of \"\"violent felony\"\" under 924(e)(2) (b)(ii) defines it as a felony that \"\"is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\" in preston , the third circuit, having determined that conspiracy fell within the subsection (i) definition, did not explicitly reach subsection (ii). in a footnote, however, the court stated that conspiracies to commit violent felonies \"\"would appear to be included within subsection (ii), because they otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\" preston , 910 f.2d at 87 n. 8. declining to reach the question, the court noted that \"\"congress may have intended to limit subsection (ii) to property crimes.\"\" id. an examination of the history of subsection (ii), however, as summarized by the supreme court in taylor , illustrates that the reference to property crimes was added just before passage, and the primary purpose of the subsection was to expand the predicate offenses that could support an enhanced sentence. the version of subsection (ii) originally reported by the house committee on the judiciary read as follows: \"\"(ii) involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\" taylor , 495 u.s. at 586 , 110 s.ct. at 2152 . only just prior to enactment were the specific references to the property crimes added to the subsection, to make clear their inclusion as predicate offenses. id. at 587 , 110 s.ct. at 2152 . thus, subsection (ii) is not limited to property offenses, but rather includes them along with other violent crimes. we believe the fourth circuit was correct in holding that \"\"the catchall, 'otherwise' clause of [subsection (ii)] must be limited in its application to offenses which, as defined, pose by their very nature a serious potential risk of injury to another.\"\" united states v. headspeth , 852 f.2d 753, 759 (4th cir.1988). a strong argument can be made that a conspiracy to commit a violent felony presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, and is therefore itself a \"\"violent felony\"\" for purposes of 18 u.s.c. 924(e) . construing 18 u.s.c. 924(c) , providing for an enhanced sentence if the offender used a deadly weapon while committing a \"\"crime of violence,\"\" two circuits have determined that a conspiracy to commit such a crime creates a \"\"substantial risk\"\" of violence, and that therefore a conspiracy conviction may form the basis for a sentence enhancement in that context. united states v. greer , 939 f.2d 1076, 1099 (5th cir.1991), aff'd in pertinent part , 968 f.2d 433, 438 (5th cir.1992) (en banc); united states v. chimurenga , 760 f.2d 400, 403-04 (2d cir.1985); see also united states v. cruz , 805 f.2d 1464, 1474 n. 11 (11th cir.1986), cert. denied , 481 u.s. 1006 , 107 s.ct. 1631 , 95 l.ed.2d 204 (1987). although we have not considered this precise issue previously, we do not write on a clean slate. in united states v. strahl , 958 f.2d 980 (10th cir.1992), we held that attempted burglary was not a violent felony for purposes of 924(e) . this court rejected an argument that it involved conduct presenting \"\"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\"\" within the compass of 924(e)(2) (b)(ii). following taylor 's categorical approach of focusing upon the statutory elements, rather than the specific conduct underlying the conviction, we stated that attempted burglary convictions could be for conduct that does not involve risk of physical injury; \"\"these offenses do not necessarily present circumstances which create the high risk of violent confrontation inherent in a completed burglary.\"\" strahl , 958 f.2d at 986 . in so holding, this court cited legislative history of unenacted predecessor bills to that which contained 924 , that had explicitly included attempts to commit burglary as violent felonies. to the extent legislative history is relevant here, we note that those unenacted provisions also included conspiracy as a predicate offense, along with attempts. id. (citing s. 52, 98th cong., 2d sess. 2 (1984) and s. 1688, 97th cong., 2d sess. 2 (1982)). no reference to conspiracy, however, was included in the final version ultimately enacted. we followed strahl in united states v. permenter , 969 f.2d 911 (10th cir.1992). reviewing an argument that the defendant's attempted burglary presented a \"\"serious risk of potential injury\"\" within the meaning of 18 u.s.c. 924(e)(2)(b)(ii) , we stated: \"\"in strahl , however, we did not look beyond the relevant statutory language in discussing mr. strahl's prior conviction for attempted burglary in utah, nor did we remand for further consideration of the attempted burglary conviction.\"\" id. at 913 . we then refused to go beyond the face of the statute, even to consider the accusations of actual conduct in the information charging the defendant with the attempted burglary crime. we believe these prior tenth circuit cases and the approach they articulate require us to look only to the elements of the conspiracy crime under new mexico law. because they \"\"do not necessarily present circumstances which created the high risk of violent confrontation inherent in a completed [armed robbery],\"\"

1 . although the district court denied defendant's motion for dismissal of the sherman act count at the close of all the evidence, it subsequently reversed its position and granted defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal after discharge of the jury pursuant to fed.r.crim.p. 29(c) . the decision of the district court is reported as united states v. reicher , 777 f.supp. 901 (d.n.m.1991). the united states has appealed. reicher was indicted for his participation in a scheme to rig bids for the award of a contract with los alamos national laboratory (the lab). in 1984, engineers at the lab became interested in building a specialized structure for laser testing (the optical channel assembly, or oca), to be assembled from urethane insulated panels. at the time, reicher's company, b.d. reicher & son, inc., was the regional representative for bally, one of the major insulated panel manufacturers. over a period of several months, reicher and one of his employees worked with engineers at the lab modifying the oca specifications to accommodate bally's standard panel measurements. in june 1985, lab officials sent out bid packages to prospective bidders appearing on a list it had compiled. because the lab procurement officer had determined that there were numerous companies throughout the country capable of building the oca from the final specifications, it was decided that the project would be bid competitively. lab procurement procedure required the submission of at least two bids for the project to be let. however, as the deadline for the submission of bids approached, reicher learned that his company's was likely to be the only bid. based on his discussions with lab officials, reicher believed that if the oca project were not let in this round of bidding, there would be insufficient time to select a contractor by other means before the end of the year, after which the funds would no longer be available. so, to insure that the oca project would be let and that his company would be the successful bidder, reicher called james giolas of giolas sales company, another potential bidder appearing on the lab bid list. reicher persuaded giolas to sign a bid form and mail it to reicher without filling in a quotation. reicher and one of his employees subsequently completed giolas' blank bid form and submitted it to the lab. the lab awarded the contract to b.d. reicher & son as the low bidder. a district court decision \"\"setting aside a jury verdict of guilty is entitled to no deference.\"\" united states v. hayes int'l corp. , 786 f.2d 1499, 1500 (11th cir.1986). we therefore review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, in a light most favorable to the prosecution. united states v. bishop , 890 f.2d 212, 219 (10th cir.1989). section one of the sherman antitrust act provides: 15 u.s.c. 1 . despite this broad language, almost from its inception the sherman act has been read to prohibit only those restraints of trade that are unreasonable. board of trade v. united states , 246 u.s. 231, 238 , 38 s.ct. 242, 244 , 62 l.ed. 683 (1918). however, in addition to this rule of reason the courts have also developed a doctrine of per se violations to cover those business relationships that \"\"because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.\"\" northern pac. ry. co. v. united states , 356 u.s. 1, 5 , 78 s.ct. 514, 518 , 2 l.ed.2d 545 (1958). bid rigging is one such per se violation. united states v. mobile materials, inc. , 881 f.2d 866, 869 (10th cir.1989), cert. denied , 493 u.s. 1043 , 110 s.ct. 837 , 107 l.ed.2d 833 (1990). bid rigging is defined as: 15 u.s.c. section 1 id. (quoting united states v. portsmouth paving corp. , 694 f.2d 312, 325 (4th cir.1982)). in acquitting reicher of the antitrust violation, the district court placed particular emphasis on the word \"\"competitors.\"\" it found that because the evidence was clear that giolas' company could not have performed the contract had it won the bid, giolas was only an \"\"apparent competitor\"\" of reicher's, and without two companies capable of competing there could be no conspiracy actionable under the antitrust laws. 777 f.supp. at 905-06 . because we believe the district court's interpretation of the word \"\"competitors\"\" is too narrow, we reverse. here the decisive circumstance in defining \"\"competitors\"\" is the simple fact that giolas sales submitted a bid for the oca contract. despite its ultimate inability to perform the contract, giolas held itself out as a competitor for the purposes of rigging what was supposed to be a competitive bidding process. this is exactly the sort of \"\"threat to the central nervous system of the economy,\"\" united states v. socony-vacuum oil co. , 310 u.s. 150, 226 n. 59, 60 s.ct. 811, 846 n. 59, 84 l.ed. 1129 (1940), that the antitrust laws are meant to address. the cases cited by the district court in support of its position do not hold otherwise. the cases on which reicher relies most heavily for the proposition that physical incapacity should be an issue in determining competitors in a relevant market are united states v. sargent elec. co. , 785 f.2d 1123 (3d cir.), cert. denied , 479 u.s. 819 , 107 s.ct. 82 , 93 l.ed.2d 36 (1986), and united states v. ashland-warren, inc. , 537 f.supp. 433 (m.d.tenn.1982). in sargent (a 2 to 1 decision in which each judge wrote separately) the lead opinion stated that the initial inquiry is whether each party to a conspiracy was \"\"an actual or potential competitor in that market\"\" and that \"\"[a]n agreement among persons who are not actual or potential competitors in a relevant market is for sherman act purposes brutum fulmen [an empty threat].\"\" 785 f.2d at 1127 . in ashland-warren the court stated that \"\"price-fixing by means of bidrigging is flatly impossible when the alleged conspirators are not also competitors unless the offending group consists of competitors, a bidrigging scheme lacks any utility.\"\" 537 f.supp. at 445 . the two cases, however, involved whether there were multiple conspiracies; the remarks were made in the context of deciding whether double jeopardy protected against a second conviction for bid rigging in different geographical areas; and in each the defendant was found not entitled to the defense. the cases are distinguishable and we believe, properly construed, are not inconsistent with our holding in the instant case. 1 several circuit courts have found antitrust violations when one of the conspirators lacked the capacity to perform the contract. in united states v. finis p. ernest, inc. , 509 f.2d 1256 (7th cir.), cert. denied , 423 u.s. 893 , 96 s.ct. 191 , 46 l.ed.2d 124 (1975), the seventh circuit concluded there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for bid rigging when the high bidder prepared its quotation without contacting suppliers or inspecting the work site, and was already committed to other work to the extent of its bonding capacity. id. at 1262 . the fifth circuit reached a similar result in united states v. mmr corp. , 907 f.2d 489 (5th cir.1990), cert. denied , u.s. , 111 s.ct. 1388 , 113 l. ed.2d 445 (1991). in that case, mmr appeared on the relevant bid list but declined to submit a bid in exchange for a subcontract from the bid winner. the court found an antitrust violation even though mmr had never handled such a large project on its own, and even though the job greatly exceeded its bonding capacity. id. at 492, 497 . the fourth circuit has also faced a situation similar to the one before us. in united states v. w.f. brinkley & son constr. co. , 783 f.2d 1157 (4th cir.1986), a bidder on a city sewer project was unable to prepare a competitive bid because one of its subcontractors could not give it an estimate. it decided to submit a bid anyway, so rather than guess an amount it called brinkley, who was also bidding on the project, for a \"\"safe\"\" number. the court held that at the point brinkley consented to providing a safe number there was a bid rigging agreement between competitors, even though the high bidder could not have performed the contract. the effect of the agreement was to negate the competitive benefits of sealed bidding. id. at 1160 . these cases illustrate that in a bid rigging conspiracy, the determination of a per se antitrust violation depends on whether there was an agreement to subvert the competition, not on whether each party to the scam could perform. the lab was obliged to consider all the bids it received, and entitled to assume that bids actually submitted were bona fide. had it not received giolas' bid it necessarily would have changed the oca specifications in such a way as to obtain competition for a rebidding process, or it would have negotiated a contract with reicher's company. in a negotiated contract it would have scrutinized the costs in a manner presumed to be unnecessary when there are competitive bids. thus, notwithstanding giolas' undisputed incapacity, through their agreement reicher and giolas were able to manipulate the bidding and lull the lab into the belief it had the benefits of true competition. having bid on the job, and having created the appearance of legitimate competition in an open bidding process, they cannot now escape the inevitable conclusion of dirty dealing by denying that they were competitors. we therefore reverse the district court's grant of defendant's motion for acquittal and order the jury's verdict reinstated. we remand for further proceedings consiste

, circuit judge. defendant bradley graves appeals the district court's refusal to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea on two firearms-related charges. for the reasons stated below, we affirm. in january 1996, mr. graves pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of 18 u.s.c. 922(g) , and one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, a violation of 18 u.s.c. 924(c) . in exchange for mr. graves' guilty plea on these two counts, the government dismissed four other firearm and drug-related charges. in march 1996, mr. graves filed a motion to withdraw his plea. the district court denied the motion based on its substantial compliance with rule 11 and mr. graves' awareness of the charges to which he pled guilty. the court then sentenced mr. graves to 131 months in prison. although a defendant's motion to withdraw a plea before sentencing should be \"\"freely allowed and treated with liberality,\"\" a trial court's decision on this issue is nevertheless discretionary. barker v. united states , 579 f.2d 1219, 1223 (10th cir.1978). we therefore review the district court's denial of mr. graves' motion for abuse of discretion and will not reverse absent a showing that the court acted \"\"unjustly or unfairly.\"\" id. we consider the district court's finding of a factual basis for mr. graves' guilty plea under the \"\"clearly erroneous\"\" standard of review. united states v. barnhardt , 93 f.3d 706, 708-09 (10th cir.1996). rule 32(d) of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that a district court may allow a defendant to withdraw his or her guilty plea before sentencing \"\"upon a showing of any fair and just reason.\"\" fed.r.crim.p. 32(d) . the burden of demonstrating a fair and just reason rests with the defendant, based on the following considerations: (1) defendant's assertion of innocence; (2) resulting prejudice to the government; (3) defendant's delay in filing the withdrawal motion; (4) inconvenience to the court; (5) defendant's assistance of counsel; (6) knowledge and voluntariness of the plea; and (7) resulting waste of judicial resources. united states v. gordon , 4 f.3d 1567, 1572 (10th cir.1993). on appeal, mr. graves offers three \"\"fair and just\"\" reasons why the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his plea. first, he denies engaging in any drug trafficking crime and therefore claims to be innocent of the 924(c) charge. second, he argues that his plea regarding the 924(c) charge lacked a factual basis. finally, mr. graves contends that his plea was not intelligently or voluntarily made because he was not presented with the final plea agreement until the night before trial, leaving him little time to consider his decision. we consider each argument in turn. to sustain a conviction under 18 u.s.c. 924(c) for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, the government must prove that the defendant committed the underlying drug count, though a separate conviction on that count is not necessary. united states v. hill , 971 f.2d 1461, 1467 (10th cir.1992). thus, if mr. graves did not in fact engage in the drug trafficking crime alleged in the government's indictment--possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine--then he is factually innocent of the 924(c) charge and presents an arguably fair and just reason to withdraw his plea. given the facts contained in the presentence report and mr. graves' oral and written representations to the district court at his rule 11 hearing, however, we are not concerned in this instance that an innocent defendant mistakenly pled guilty to a crime he did not commit. in its presentence report, the u.s. probation office noted the following with regard to the charges to which mr. graves pled guilty: because mr. graves did not object to the facts contained in the presentence report, they are deemed admitted. united states v. deninno , 29 f.3d 572, 580 (10th cir.1994). as a result, we can only conclude that mr. graves' claim of innocence is inconsistent with the observations of the wichita police officers who ultimately apprehended him. mr. graves' oral and written statements to the district court at his plea hearing also belie his claim of innocence. the district court asked mr. graves on four different occasions whether he understood the counts to which he was pleading guilty, naming the offenses listed in those counts twice. each time, mr. graves assured the court that he understood the offenses at issue and wished to enter a guilty plea. similarly, mr. graves' written petition to enter a guilty plea represented to the court that he understood the charges to which he was pleading guilty, that he committed the acts alleged in those two charges, and that he did not believe he was innocent. given these statements and the facts contained in the presentence report, mr. graves' claim of innocence on appeal is simply unpersuasive to establish the district court's abuse of discretion in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea. for the same reasons, we also reject mr. graves' argument on appeal that the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his plea because it lacked a factual basis regarding the 924(c) charge, as required by rule 11(f). 1 we recognize that mr. graves did not expressly provide a factual basis for his participation in any drug trafficking crime when questioned by the district court regarding his plea. when asked what he had done that would make him guilty of the 924(c) charge, mr. graves responded, \"\"i was around people that was selling drugs and knowledgeable of it, and had a weapon at the time that the drugs transactions was taking place.\"\" we also recognize, however, that the district court considering mr. graves' plea was entitled to draw inferences from this statement, as would a jury at trial. see united states v. ledonne , 21 f.3d 1418, 1428 (7th cir.1994). though certainly mr. graves' rule 11 hearing could have been handled more precisely, we hold the district court did not commit clear error in finding a factual basis for his plea at the time the plea was entered. moreover, we note that under rule 11(f), a court may also satisfy the factual basis requirement by examining the presentence report. united states v. elias , 937 f.2d 1514, 1517 (10th cir.1991). in this instance, the above-excerpted portion of the report indicates that mr. graves was actively involved in drug trafficking and that he and another individual had crack cocaine in their possession. as a result, the presentence report provides ample support for the district court's finding that a factual basis for the plea existed when considering mr. graves' motion to withdraw. accordingly, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow mr. graves to withdraw his plea on this ground. equally unpersuasive is mr. graves' claim on appeal that the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his plea because he lacked adequate time to consider the government's final plea proposal. in this instance, plea negotiations with the government began in august 1995, when the indictment was first filed. thus, mr. graves had months to consider the implications of the plea negotiations in which he was involved. because mr. graves did not ask for more time to consider his offer and admits receiving adequate advice from counsel regarding his plea, he cannot argue on appeal that his decision was too rushed or made without full information. we therefore conclude that mr. graves' third argument on appeal, like the first two, is without merit and that the district court's denial of his motion to withdraw was well within its sound discretion. having rejected mr. graves' proffered justifications for withdrawing his plea, we pause only to note that this defendant would have been eligible for career offender sentencing had he been convicted of the offenses that were dismissed in this case, resulting in over twenty years' incarceration. that being the case, mr. graves lacks not only a \"\"fair and just\"\" reason to withdraw his plea, but a prudent one as wel

18 u.s.c. 3571(b)(6) (raising maximum fine to $5,000). the crime charged is a class b misdemeanor (because the maximum authorized punishment is more than thirty days but no more than six months, 18 u.s.c. 3559(a)(7) ) and a \"\"petty offense,\"\" a category which includes misdemeanors of classes b and c, plus \"\"infractions,\"\" 18 u.s.c. 19 . 1 after a two-day trial to the court, unser was convicted and was sentenced to pay a fine of $75. this case arises from a story of survival in the wilderness under extreme conditions and involves legal issues requiring examination of some of the most fundamental concepts in criminal law. like the parties obviously do, we view the case as having significance beyond the penalty actually imposed. i a we will begin with an overview of the facts. our summary in this part of the opinion is based on the testimony of the defendant, who was the only witness at trial to have been present during the primary events. much of this evidence was undisputed; we will note later in the opinion the critical areas which are in dispute. on friday, december 20, 1996, mr. unser set off to go snowmobiling with a friend, robert gayton. unser, who lives in albuquerque and has a ranch near chama in far northern new mexico, was very experienced with snowmobiles and fairly familiar with the place he chose for them to ride. gayton had never been on a snowmobile before, and so took a few minutes to practice on the snowmobile at unser's ranch. the two then loaded two snowmobiles onto a trailer and made a short drive on state highways across the state line into far southern colorado, high in the san juan range of the rocky mountains near la manga pass. they parked at the red lake trail parking lot on state highway 17. from there, unser planned a fairly short ride to the jarosa peak area of the rio grande national forest. unser planned on a fairly short ride for several reasons. it was already midday when they reached the parking lot to begin riding, and of course nightfall would come early at that time of the year. while unser was a very experienced rider, he had only recently recovered from back surgery, and his companion, as we have noted, was a beginner. gayton rode around a few minutes in the immediate area of the parking lot to get more familiar with the machine and to riding in the deeper snow at the higher elevation near the pass. the two then set off for the jarosa peak area. the area around this peak includes a mesa, sometimes referred to as jarosa mesa, which was a climb of a few hundred feet from the parking lot. unser said he chose this place because it was a fairly short and easy, yet interesting, ride for the beginner, gayton. the weather was clear at first, but when the two men reached the mesa, unser testified, a \"\"ground blizzard\"\" came up rather suddenly. a ground blizzard was described as the result of high winds blowing substantial amounts of fallen snow; these conditions may arise when no new snow is falling. visibility was near zero. unser's machine started having problems (the engine died repeatedly for the rest of the ill fated ride), and the situation became dangerous. the two men got lost trying to find their way back to the truck. then, gayton went off into a small ravine and his machine was stuck. they abandoned it and rode on. as they did, they were continually having to work on unser's machine to get it restarted. eventually, it failed completely. the men started walking but were still lost when night came. they dug a snow cave and spent the night in it. the next day they continued their wanderings on foot, suffering greatly. they hiked through the day and night until some time after midnight when they came upon a barn equipped with a telephone. they were soon rescued. they were treated at a local hospital for frostbite, dehydration and exhaustion. b we will now review other evidence presented at trial. while mr. unser and mr. gayton were lost in the rugged terrain of the national forest battling the extreme cold and other adverse elements, friends and family were aware that they had not returned on friday evening. on saturday december 21 a search and rescue operation was organized. some friends of unser went up from chama to the parking lot where his truck had been noticed. on arriving there, they were told by a local deputy sheriff that they would have to wait for the authorized search and rescue team from colorado to arrive, which they did. eventually, six to eight people went out from the trail head on snowmobiles looking for unser and gayton. the rescuers did not actually get out on the mountain until mid-afternoon, and so had only a couple of hours before nightfall. in that time they found the snowmobile that gayton had been riding, but were unable to find enough tracks to determine which way the two men had gone from there. at trial four witnesses who had participated in the search and rescue operation testified. only one of these witnesses, richard martin, was called by the government. martin is a resident of southern colorado and a veteran of a number of similar rescue efforts. martin testified that the conditions were not bad on december 21 as the group began their search. the men were able to find tracks and, at least at first, to follow the path that unser and gayton had made the previous day. from the tracks, it appeared that unser had started out from the parking lot on a fairly well defined trail, one which had in years past been used by cattlemen taking stock up to summer pastures. (we note at this point that all the witnesses at trial agreed that unser's ill fated ride had begun along this route, but opinions were divided on where he might have gone after the first five or six miles.) that trail led up to what the witnesses referred to as jarosa mesa (but it is not clear from the record just how far this area goes). conditions up on the mesa were very bad, as visibility was greatly reduced by blowing snow. martin testified that he found tracks on the mesa which appeared to have been made when unser and gayton were merely riding for fun; at the judge's suggestion, he marked \"\"pt\"\" on the enlarged map exhibit to show the area where he had found these \"\"play tracks.\"\" the rescuers attempted to follow unser's tracks from there, but tracking became very difficult because so many of the tracks had been erased by blowing snow by that time. eventually, martin found the snowmobile that gayton had been riding. martin testified that the tracks he had been following just before he found this first snowmobile indicated to him that the riders were lost and trying to find their way. the rescue team extricated the abandoned snow mobile and rode on, dividing into two groups. at nightfall, they suspended their efforts for the day. martin marked on the map for the court the point where he estimated that the first snow mobile had been found and made a line to show the route he believed he had taken to this point. the route as drawn by martin proceeds for slightly over three miles in a northwesterly direction, almost in a straight line from the point where martin had marked \"\"play tracks\"\" on the map, and ends about two miles past the boundary of the wilderness area. this testimony was later cited by the trial judge as the most credible and consistent evidence as to the location of the first machine, an issue of fact which was of considerable significance because of other findings by the judge, as we shall see. it is worth noting that martin's testimony was far from precise. martin was candid in describing his effort as being less than certain, twice describing it as a guess. when the rescuers split into groups after having found the first abandoned snowmobile, martin had ridden to red lake, which was northeast of the point he marked on the map as the likely location of the first machine. martin testified that his estimate of the location of the snowmobile was based in part on his belief that he had been going northeast from that point to red lake during the rescue efforts. martin had gone back to the area only a few days before trial in the company of forest service agent burd, among others, to see if he could retrace the path he had taken during the rescue effort. martin testified that they were very careful to stay out of the wilderness area and stopped before reaching the place where martin believed the first snow mobile had been found. (although it was june when this effort was made, they were on snowmobiles.) as the defense has emphasized, both at trial and on appeal, martin said that the odometer on his snowmobile read 7.2 miles when he turned back at a point he (or others with him) estimated to have been about a quarter of a mile short of the wilderness boundary. 2 martin also testified that during this second visit to the area he tested his sense of direction and found that he was off by eighty degrees. he was not asked to explain whether he had accounted for this when he testified that he believed that the first snowmobile had been found southwest of red lake. c about three weeks after this adventure, unser contacted officials with the forest service's office in albuquerque for assistance in finding the second snowmobile. unser met with ben tafoya, a forest service agent, on january 7, 1997, in albuquerque. because he had been told that he might need a permit to retrieve the machine, unser brought with him a friend, gabe valdez, and manny martinez. before retiring, manny martinez had been a supervisor in the law enforcement unit of the forest service and indeed had formerly been tafoya's immediate supervisor. these men met and went over maps trying to determine where the machine might have been abandoned, but they believed that they had accomplished little. further efforts were planned for the next day. tafoya told unser that he would contact officials with the colorado offices of the forest service who would be more familiar with the area and of more assistance. when tafoya first contacted officials in colorado, he asked to speak to chris ortiz, the law enforcement officer for that area. ortiz told tafoya that he should speak with brenda schultz or charlie burd, who were investigating the incident for possible violation of the ban on use of motor vehicles in a wilderness area, having determined that unser probably had entered the south san juan wilderness area of the rio grande national forest. those two agents, burd and schultz, arranged to come to meet with unser at tafoya's office the following day. tafoya was asked not to tell unser that these officers wanted to talk to him as part of their criminal investigation. instead, tafoya merely told unser that two agents were coming down from colorado who could help him locate and retrieve his snowmobile. charlie burd, special agent with the forest service, testified that he, along with brenda schultz, met with unser the next day for about three and a half hours in a conference room near tafoya's office in albuquerque. unser came by himself to this meeting. burd indicated that unser was mostly cooperative during this meeting, but burd suggested that unser was less than candid at times in saying that he had no idea which way he had gone after leaving jarosa mesa. after lengthy and not very productive discussions, burd asked unser to draw a sketch of the valley where the second machine had been abandoned. from this sketch, burd testified he was able to recognize the area. burd then showed unser an aerial photograph, using a stereoscopic device to give the photo a three dimensional effect. unser immediately recognized the photograph burd had selected. six months later, just the week before trial, burd located the second machine, still stuck in the snow, very near the place that he and unser had identified in the january meeting. burd marked that point on the topographical map that martinez had used in his testimony, government's exhibit 3. the point is almost due east of the point identified by martinez as the most likely location of the recovery of the first machine. burd testified that unser never indicated to him that he had any concern for his safety until the second snowmobile failed. unser had said that he had been in this area about ten times before, but that he was unsure just where they had gone because he simply had not been paying attention while he was enjoying the sport. according to burd's testimony, unser told him that after the first machine got stuck, with the weather beginning to be bad, unser decided to try to head straight back to the parking lot, rather than to return by retracing their path. unser had told tafoya that at that point he started following the \"\"windrows.\"\" windrows are wave like patterns in the snow which, tafoya testified, would generally run east to west in this area. d as for the defense evidence, for purposes of our review we need not go into any detail. the trial judge clearly did not find much of the defendant's evidence on critical issues to be credible. it is sufficient to note that two members of the rescue team attempted to locate on the map the point where they thought the first snowmobile had been recovered, and like defendant in his testimony, both fixed this point as being outside the wilderness area, before unser and gayton would have reached the wilderness boundary. matthew martinez testified that he was among those who went back to the area on sunday, december 22, after unser and gayton had been rescued, to retrieve the first snowmobile. he said that the snowmobile's odometer showed eight miles plus some tenths. several witnesses agreed that a snowmobile's odometer usually shows more miles than has actually been traveled. this is because the odometer registers revolutions of the track, which often slips especially when the rider is attempting to climb a steep slope. mr. burd testified that the route apparently taken by unser up to the top of jarosa mesa was so steep that when he made the climb himself he thought at first that his machine would not be able to do it. ii on appeal from a criminal conviction, of course, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. in the instant case, where the trial judge found the facts specially, even though not requested to do so, 3 the findings may not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. campbell v. united states , 373 u.s. 487, 493 , 83 s.ct. 1356 , 10 l.ed.2d 501 (1963). we will summarize the district judge's findings as a prelude to our analysis of the legal issues raised by mr. unser. although there is essentially no dispute as to the main events as described by unser and as we have just summarized, there certainly was dispute about important details. the trial judge did not credit unser's testimony in its entirety. in particular, the judge found that the two riders left the jarosa peak area before any emergency arose and that they were intentionally riding northwest, further away from where they had begun their ride, because they were still just riding for fun. the judge found that mr. martin's testimony as to the location of the first snowmobile was the most credible, and he gave several reasons for this finding. the fact that the second machine was eventually recovered almost due east from where mr. martin fixed the location of the first machine was consistent with the unser's statements, both in the interview with burd and in his trial testimony, that after abandoning the first machine he and gayton attempted to follow the windrows, which the evidence established ran west to east. the judge found that the odometer reading on the first machine, when it was recovered, was a little over eight miles. the judge then said that he had used a piece of wire to determine the distance to the spot on the map marked by mr. martin, following the route martin had said that rescuers had used in following the tracks left by unser and gayton. from this examination of the evidence, the judge determined that it was about 4.2 miles from the parking lot to the place which martin had estimated to be the location of the abandoned first snowmobile. (in fact, the judge misread the scale of the map; the distance is twice what he found it to be. this is clear because he made findings about other points on the map, each of which is plainly based on the same erroneous reading of the scale of miles.) the judge then proceeded to consider unser's contention that if he had entered the wilderness area with a snowmobile, he had done so only under a life-threatening emergency. the judge had held before trial that unser would have the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. this conclusion was based on another holding made before trial, i.e. , that the offense charged was a strict liability offense and accordingly the government would not have to prove any intent to snowmobile in the wilderness area, nor would the government have to prove that unser knew that he had entered a wilderness area. the judge stated, \"\"[t]he law ought to afford, and i believe does, a measure of defense to the citation issued here based upon emergency and defenses otherwise known essentially as a necessity defense, sometimes called a choice of evils defense.\"\" ii app. at 687. accordingly, in the judge's view it was critical to determine whether emergency conditions had arisen before or after unser had entered the wilderness area. the judge specifically found that an emergency did not arise until \"\"either just before or just after mr. gayton's machine got stuck.\"\" ii app. at 689. based on his finding that the more credible evidence was that the first machine had been found inside the wilderness boundary, the judge concluded and held that the defense had failed to carry the burden of establishing the necessity defense, and pronounced the defendant guilty. this appeal followed. the major contentions of defendant unser on appeal are: (1) the district judge erred by holding that the offense of violation of 16 u.s.c. 551 and 36 c.f.r. 261.16(a) of possessing and using a motor vehicle in a wilderness area contains no mens rea requirement; (2) the judge erred by denying defendant unser the necessity defense in the emergency conditions that confronted unser and his companion; and (3) the judge erred in denying defendant unser's motion to suppress his statement based on the involuntariness of the statement and violation of his rights under the miranda doctrine. we will analyze these issues in turn. iii first, we address the mens rea issue: \"\"few areas of criminal law pose more difficulty than the proper definition of the mens rea required for any particular crime.\"\" united states v. bailey , 444 u.s. 394, 403 , 100 s.ct. 624 , 62 l.ed.2d 575 (1980). our task is to determine, as best we can, the intent of congress in empowering the secretary of agriculture to adopt regulations applicable to national forest lands and enforceable by criminal penalties. then, having found that intent, we must determine whether the intent is compatible with due process. unfortunately, we find little direct guidance in the language congress used. 4 the regulation promulgated by the secretary of agriculture likewise reveals little on this question. 5 however, while the statute and regulation involved here do not contain a mens rea element, \"\"silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest that the [legislators] intended to dispense with a conventional mens rea element.\"\" staples v. united states , 511 u.s. 600, 605 , 114 s.ct. 1793 , 128 l.ed.2d 608 (1994); morissette v. united states , 342 u.s. 246, 263 , 72 s.ct. 240 , 96 l.ed. 288 (1952); united states v. martinez-morel , 118 f.3d 710, 716 (10th cir.1997). morissette also noted, however, that the general presumption that some guilty purpose is required is not applicable to what have been termed public welfare offenses, which typically impose penalties to serve as an effective means of regulation. the court's observations about the nature of such public welfare offenses provide a helpful starting point for our analysis: hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element. the accused, if he does not will the violation, usually is in a position to prevent it with no more care than society might reasonably expect and no more exertion than it might reasonably exact from one who assumed his responsibilities. also, penalties commonly are relatively small, and conviction does no grave damage to an offender's reputation. under such considerations, courts have turned to construing statutes and regulations which make no mention of intent as dispensing with it and holding that the guilty act alone makes out the crime morissette , 342 u.s. at 255-56 , 72 s.ct. 240 (emphasis added). following morissette , the eighth circuit has stated that holdridge v. united states , 282 f.2d 302, 310 (8th cir.1960)(blackmun, j.); see also tart v. massachusetts , 949 f.2d 490, 502 (1st cir.1991). additionally, the supreme court has indicated that most public welfare offenses involve situations where a reasonable person should know that the conduct is subject to stringent regulation and may seriously threaten a community's health or safety. liparota v. united states , 471 u.s. 419, 433 , 105 s.ct. 2084 , 85 l.ed.2d 434 (1985). the government contends, and we agree, that the regulation at issue here satisfies most of these criteria, conceding however that the conduct in question does not seem to seriously threaten a community's health or safety. the government states: \"\"admittedly, it is difficult [to] characterize the use of motorized vehicles in a wilderness area as conduct 'that may seriously threaten a community's health or safety.'\"\" brief of appellee at 14 (quoting liparota v. united states , 471 u.s. 419, 433 , 105 s.ct. 2084 , 85 l.ed.2d 434 (1985)). nevertheless, we are persuaded that 16 u.s.c. 551 and 36 c.f.r. 261.16(a) , the applicable statute and regulation involved here, do create a \"\"public welfare offense.\"\" indeed, several other courts have found that such forest service regulations define public welfare offenses. e.g. , united states v. kent , 945 f.2d 1441, 1446 (9th cir.1991)(unauthorized occupancy of national forest land); united states v. larson , 746 f.2d 455, 456 (8th cir.1984) (trespass by cattle); united states v. wilson , 438 f.2d 525 (9th cir.1971) (cutting wood); united states v. northwest pine products , 914 f.supp. 404 (d.ore.1996) (timber operations); but see united states v. semenza , 835 f.2d 223 (9th cir.1987)(mental element held implied in offense of allowing unauthorized livestock entry in national forest); united states v. launder , 743 f.2d 686 (9th cir.1984)(proof required of some intent or fault in permitting fire out of control in national forest) united states v. osguthorpe , 13 f.supp.2d 1215 (d.utah 1998) (mental element required for offense of allowing unauthorized livestock to enter national forest). we must decide the effect of the omission from the statute and regulation of a mens rea requirement. under the proposition distilled by justice blackmun's holdridge opinion for the eighth circuit from earlier cases, 242 f.2d at 310 , we are persuaded that most of the conditions are met for treating the offense charged here as a public welfare offense lacking a mens rea requirement: there is, as noted, no mention of an intent in the statute or regulation; the duty imposed is reasonable, under the circumstances, and adherence properly expected; the statutory scheme is not one taken from the common law and congressional purpose is supportive; and conviction does not gravely besmirch one's reputation, involving only a misdemeanor. the troublesome question remaining is whether \"\"the penalty is relatively small.\"\" holdridge , 282 f.2d at 310 . taking into account the 1987 increase in the potential fine, the maximum penalties are a $5,000 fine, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. these are not de minimis , in our judgment, but the test is whether \"\"the penalty is relatively small ,\"\" as holdridge , 282 f.2d at 310 (emphasis added), states. this follows the test laid down by the supreme court in morissette , that \"\"penalties commonly are relatively small ,\"\" 342 u.s. at 256 , 72 s.ct. 240 (emphasis added), for public welfare offenses where no mention of intent is made and the guilty act alone makes out the crime. in staples , the court noted that cases that first defined the concept of public welfare offenses involved statutes that \"\"punished only light penalties such as fines or short jail sentences \"\" 511 u.s. at 616 , 114 s.ct. 1793 . 6 later staples referred to \"\" small penalties \"\" being attached to such public welfare offenses as logically complementing the absence of a mens rea requirement. id. (emphasis added). we have addressed a similar issue in united states v. corrow , 119 f.3d 796, 805 (10th cir.1997), cert. denied , u.s. , 118 s.ct. 1089 , 140 l.ed.2d 146 (1998), in the context of migratory bird treaty act misdemeanor violations carrying a potential fine up to $5,000 or imprisonment of not more than six months, or both. see 16 u.s.c. 707(a) and 18 u.s.c. 3571(b) (raising maximum fine up to $5,000 in 1987). in corrow , we joined other circuits in holding such offenses are strict liability without a scienter requirement. this 1996 offense occurred in a time frame when heavier sentences of imprisonment and fines are more common. in light of these circumstances and the lack of besmirching an offender's reputation by a felony conviction, we are persuaded that the public welfare offense in question here was properly held by the district judge not to have a required mens rea element. iv as we have earlier noted, the district judge held that unser could assert a common law defense of necessity, based on the life threatening situation he faced when he became lost in the extreme conditions that have been described. the judge eventually ruled, however, that unser had not carried the burden of proving the necessity defense by a preponderance of the evidence. unser argues on appeal that the district judge erred in holding that he had the burden of proof on the necessity defense, 7 and also argues that the evidence showed that any entry into the wilderness area should have been excused under the necessity defense. we have discussed the necessity defense on several occasions. it is well settled, and not challenged here, that the defendant at least must bear the initial burden of producing evidence which could support a finding in his favor on each element of the defense. the government does not dispute that defendant met this burden of production and that the trial judge properly considered the necessity defense in this case. various formulations of the elements of the defense may be found, but for our purposes we need only examine one such formulation. the necessity defense may excuse an otherwise unlawful act if the defendant shows that \"\"(1) there is no legal alternative to violating the law, (2) the harm to be prevented is imminent, and (3) a direct, causal relationship is reasonably anticipated to exist between defendant's action and the avoidance of harm.\"\" united states v. meraz-valeta , 26 f.3d 992, 995 (10th cir.1994) (citing united states v. seward , 687 f.2d 1270, 1276 (10th cir.1982) (en banc)). the district court's holding that the burden of proof on the defense of necessity was on the defendant was expressly based on the prior ruling that the offense charged did not include a mens rea element. i app. at 119-20 (citing united states v. toney , 27 f.3d 1245 (7th cir.1994)); ii app. at 687. the trial judge recognized the fundamental principle that the government must bear the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of a criminal offense. in re winship , 397 u.s. 358 , 90 s.ct. 1068 , 25 l.ed.2d 368 (1970). it follows from this that when evidence has been produced of a defense which, if accepted by the trier of fact, would negate an element of the offense, the government must bear the ultimate burden of persuasion on that element, including disproving the defense. mullaney v. wilbur , 421 u.s. 684 , 95 s.ct. 1881 , 44 l.ed.2d 508 (1975). 8 see generally 1 wayne r. lafave & austin w. scott, jr., substantive criminal law 1.8(c) (1986). in the instant case, however, we do not face a constitutional issue involving defendant's due process rights. the constitution permits allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant with respect to a defense which does not negate an element of the crime. e.g. , patterson v. new york , 432 u.s. 197 , 97 s.ct. 2319 , 53 l.ed.2d 281 (1977). therefore, because we have affirmed the district court's ruling that the offense charged may be proven without proof that defendant intended to take his motor vehicle into the protected area, or even knew that he had done so, the trial judge's ruling on the burden of proof on the necessity defense did not deny defendant any basic right. there still remains the question, however, whether the burden of proof was properly placed on defendant or whether some authority other than the constitution would require the opposite conclusion. unfortunately, neither the statutes, the regulations, nor the cases provide much guidance on when the burden of proof should be allocated to the defendant for such a defense. we must resolve the issue with the minimal guidance that these sources provide. one factor which is relied on is a practical one. often it is the defendant who is most likely to have access to the facts needed to prove such a defense, and this case seems to be of that type. this pragmatic element is one which may properly be taken into account, as the supreme court has recognized for at least most of this century. see morrison v. california , 291 u.s. 82, 91 , 54 s.ct. 281 , 78 l.ed. 664 (1934). in morrison , the court stated that the burden of establishing an affirmative defense may properly be placed on the defendant if there exists \"\"a manifest disparity in convenience of proof and opportunity for knowledge, as, for instance, where a general prohibition is applicable to every one who is unable to bring himself within the range of an exception.\"\" id. we think it is manifest that the regulation at issue here is \"\"a general prohibition.\"\" it would be impractical, we believe, to impose on the government the burden of disproving necessity beyond a reasonable doubt, and this case demonstrates why this is so. it would be impractical to expect that the boundaries of wilderness areas could be policed in such a way that the government would have access to evidence to disprove a necessity defense. we think, in fact, that requiring the government to disprove the necessity defense could impede enforcement of the regulatory scheme. therefore, we hold that the district judge did not err in ruling that unser had the burden of proving the defense of necessity. we note briefly that unser raises a sufficiency of the evidence issue as part of his attack on the trial court's rulings on the necessity defense. this argument is at least partially premised on the contention, which we have rejected, that the burden of proof should have been on the government to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that unser had already committed the violation by entering the wilderness area on his snowmobile before the emergency arose. that argument of course must fail as a consequence of our rejection of its premise. unser does also argue that the evidence was insufficient regardless of the burden of proof on the necessity defense. we have carefully reviewed the record and we disagree. unser's argument on this point overlooks, among other things, agent burd's testimony that unser's statements only three weeks after the ordeal were inconsistent with his trial testimony and that unser had said then that he did not know where he had gone only because he hadn't been paying much attention, not because he was lost in a ground blizzard. unser's argument on appeal also overlooks the evidence of the location of the second machine, and unser's testimony that he had been following the windrows before the second machine failed. we have already noted that the trial judge specifically relied on these facts as strong evidence of the location of the first snowmobile. the evidence as to the location of the second machine was much more certain, and the windrow evidence links that more definite point to the location of the first machine. much of unser's argument is devoted to recounting the inconsistencies in the other evidence about the location of the first machine, with particular emphasis on the district judge's mistake in reading the scale of miles on the enlarged map, exhibit 3, to which we have previously referred. 9 this part of the evidence is somewhat troublesome. applying the correct scale of miles, it appears that it is approximately 6.7 miles from the red lake trail parking lot, where the ride began, to the boundary of the wilderness. as we have noted, mr. martin, on whom the trial judge relied heavily, estimated the distance at 7.2 miles, based on his having tried to retrace the route. as unser points out, the evidence was that gayton had driven the machine twice just for practice, once at unser's ranch and once in the area of the parking lot. further, the evidence that the odometers overstate actual mileage because of slippage of the propulsion mechanism, evidence that unser and gayton had been making \"\"play tracks\"\" and then had been wandering apparently lost, and the fact that the rugged terrain would make it unlikely that the actual route taken would be as direct as a line drawn on a map, all are factors which, unser urges, make it highly unlikely, if not impossible, that gayton's machine reached the wilderness boundary, given that its odometer showed mileage of less than nine miles. although it may be that a rational fact finder could have accepted these contentions, we do not find the evidence so one-sided that we could hold the trial judge's adverse findings to be clearly erroneous. we believe that the district judge did not err in weighing all the evidence and finding that unser had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the emergency arose before he entered the wilderness area. v finally, we consider unser's contentions relating to the statements he made in the meeting with agents burd and schultz in albuquerque. unser makes two contentions. first, he says that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without having been advised of his rights under miranda v. arizona , 384 u.s. 436 , 86 s.ct. 1602 , 16 l.ed.2d 694 (1966). second, unser contends that the statements should have been suppressed because they were involuntary, being the product of deception practiced on him by the agents. the district court rejected both contentions. the judge made a specific finding of fact that unser was not in custody during the meeting, from which it followed that the agents were not required to advise him of his rights under miranda . the judge also found that unser was not coerced into making statements and concluded that the statements were voluntary. the miranda issue merits little discussion. the district court's finding that unser was not in custody is reviewed only for clear error. united states v. glover , 104 f.3d 1570, 1578 (10th cir.1997). the evidence supporting the district judge's finding that unser was not in custody was essentially undisputed and was easily sufficient. the evidence was that unser voluntarily appeared both on january 7 and january 8. during both days unser frequently took telephone calls on his cellular phone and obviously felt free to leave the room whenever he wanted because he did so, going out into the hallway to talk on the telephone several times. there was no evidence of any coercive tactics, nor of anything coercive about the atmosphere of the meeting which would have led unser to believe that he was not free to leave at any time. we affirm the district court's conclusion that there was no violation of the requirements of miranda . as to the issue of voluntariness, as noted in part i-c, supra , unser was told only that the agents would help him retrieve his snowmobile, even though the agents' purpose was to further their criminal investigation. the trial court found that \"\"a measure of subterfuge\"\" had been employed by the agents when they induced unser to return to the offices in albuquerque for the purpose of meeting with agents burd and schultz, without telling unser that he was the target of a criminal investigation and instead leading him to believe that they were simply trying to assist him in finding his abandoned snowmobile. on the other hand, the judge also found that the evidence would support a reasonable inference (which he apparently drew) that unser knew that he might be cited for entering a wilderness area. the judge referred to unser having brought retired agent martinez and retired state trooper valdez to the first meeting with agent tafoya. also, the judge referred to testimony by tafoya that at one point during his meeting with the three men, at a time when unser himself might have left the room temporarily, tafoya asked if unser had been cited. the court found as a matter of fact that unser's statements were not coerced. we review the district court's subsidiary findings of fact only for clear error, but the issue of voluntariness of the statements is ultimately a question of law which we review de novo . glover , 104 f.3d at 1579-80 . on the legal issue of whether the statements were voluntary, we consider the age, intelligence, and education of the defendant; the length of the detention (if any); the length and nature of the questioning; whether the defendant was advised of his constitutional rights; and whether physical coercion was employed. glover , 104 f.3d at 1579 . the inquiry is to include all the facts and circumstances. id. the ultimate question in this case is whether the promise of helping unser to locate his snowmobile resulted in his will being overborne. id. we find no clear error in the trial court's subsidiary findings. these included findings that unser was a man of intelligence and experience. as previously alluded to, the court found that the fact that unser initially enlisted two men with law enforcement backgrounds to accompany him to meet with tafoya suggested that unser had some idea that he might be under investigation for entering the wilderness area with his snowmobile. the judge also found, as we read his comments, that unser was a strong willed individual as evidenced by his having survived this ordeal and by other circumstances, including the fact that unser had achieved great fame and success as a race car driver in his earlier years. considering all the surrounding circumstances, we affirm the district judge's holding that the statements were voluntarily made and therefore admissible at trial. vi for</td><td>0.41113514744392576 </td></tr>\n",

, circuit judge. these three appeals arise from the same racially charged incident; therefore, we join them for the purpose of this opinion. james woodlee appeals his conviction for violent interference with federally protected activity, contending: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; (2) the court erred during sentencing; (3) the court erred when it allowed testimony regarding prior conduct; and (4) the government's brady and jencks act violations warrant a new trial. gary woodlee raises similar sufficiency of the evidence and sentencing arguments. in addition, gary woodlee maintains the court erred when it refused to admit or consider polygraph evidence during his sentencing. defendant robert kinslow appeals the court's application of a hate crime enhancement to increase his sentence. mr. kinslow maintains: (1) the court applied an incorrect legal standard when implementing the enhancement; and (2) the facts do not support the use of the enhancement. because we believe there is sufficient evidence to support the woodlees' convictions and the court did not err during trial or sentencing of any of the defendants, we affirm. david carter and tim walker, two black men, entered the stumble inn, a bar in ft. towson, oklahoma, where gary woodlee, james woodlee, and three of their friends, all white, were drinking and shooting pool. upon seeing mr. carter and mr. walker enter, james woodlee said to one of his friends, \"\"what do those n s think they are doing coming in here?\"\" after ordering a beer, mr. carter placed some quarters on the pool table to signal he was next to play. when his turn came, however, gary woodlee insisted it was not mr. carter's turn. after a brief argument, mr. carter relented and decided to leave the bar. as mr. carter and mr. walker climbed into their car, james woodlee followed them outside and yelled, \"\"that's right, you black mother f s, get on out of here.\"\" mr. carter and mr. walker drove off without responding. as he returned to the bar, james woodlee bragged, \"\"i got rid of those black mother f s; didn't i?\"\" later that evening, mr. carter and mr. walker returned to the inn with another friend, brock lockhart, who is also black. the woodlees and their friends were still at the bar, and for the remainder of the night they racially taunted the black men with statements such as: \"\"look at the black son-of-a-b s\"\" and \"\"[w]oo, that sure is a stinking n .\"\" at one point, while aiming at the eight-ball but looking at mr. carter and his friends, gary woodlee yelled he \"\"was going to shoot the s out of that black son-of-a-b .\"\" throughout the entire evening, mr. carter, mr. walker, and mr. lockhart never approached the defendants or responded to the racial taunting. finally, when the bartender saw james woodlee give gary woodlee a nine millimeter pistol, she decided to close the bar. she testified that gary woodlee said he would use the gun on \"\"them black son of a b s\"\" and \"\"s is going to go down and it ain't going to be a pretty sight.\"\" mr. carter and his friends apologized to the bartender for the inconvenience and offered to leave so the bar could stay open. mr. carter and his friends were the first to leave the bar. as they walked to their car, the group of white men followed them outside and the racial taunting and threatening spilled over into the parking area. the three black men got into mr. carter's car and drove toward home. as they drove away, mr. lockhart shouted, \"\"you guys are a bunch of a s.\"\" buddy vandever, a friend of the woodlees who had been in the bar, entered his truck, pulled out directly behind mr. carter's car, and began a high speed chase. gary woodlee and james woodlee got into their truck to join in the pursuit. before pulling out of the parking lot, they invited another friend, robert kinslow, to accompany them. prior to joining the woodlees, mr. kinslow retrieved from his own car a mini 14, .223 rifle with a scope and 20 round clip. then, with gary woodlee driving, james woodlee straddling the gear shift, and mr. kinslow in the passenger seat, the trio took up the chase. approximately, one half-mile down the road, mr. vandever's truck pulled off to the side of the road. gary woodlee slowed for a second, then continued the chase. suddenly, mr. kinslow rolled down the passenger window, aimed the rifle at mr. carter's car, and fired between three and six shots. 1 the shots shattered the rear window of the car, and mr. carter, who was sitting in the back seat, was thrown from his seat. after the driver lost control of the car and it slid into a ditch, the three men ran to a nearby house to escape further harm. later examination revealed mr. carter had holes in his shirt and baseball cap consistent with either shotgun pellets or fragmented bullets. in addition, he had been shot in the eye and had several pellets lodged in his head, face, and back. the treating physician described the metal fragment in his eye as a pellet or possibly a fragment of a bullet. the fragment was removed from his eye in an out-patient surgical procedure. as a result of the shooting, mr. carter's retina is permanently scarred. he has a permanent spot in his field of vision, experiences blurriness, and has an increased risk of retinal detachment. the other two men received minor injuries. gary woodlee, james woodlee, mr. vandever, and mr. kinslow were all charged with conspiracy to interfere with federal rights and three counts of violent interference with federally protected activities resulting in bodily injury. in addition, mr. kinslow was charged with use of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. mr. kinslow pled guilty to the conspiracy charge and the government dismissed the substantive charges. the remaining defendants went to trial. on cross-examination of mr. carter, the defendants discovered for the first time mr. carter had a nine millimeter pistol in his car the night of the incident. in addition, mr. carter revealed he had made a fourteen page statement which the prosecution had not provided to the defendants. the defendants moved for a mistrial based on the government's failure to comply with discovery, but the court denied the motion. later, the defense discovered mr. lockhart had given a statement to the fbi. the government also failed to produce this document at the appropriate time. during the trial, a witness testified to an unrelated incident involving james woodlee and a woman who was \"\"a mixture of black and white.\"\" the witness testified james woodlee refused to go on a trip with a group of friends because this woman was also going on the trip. james woodlee's counsel objected to this testimony as inadmissible 404(b) evidence. the court allowed the testimony with a limiting instruction. during deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking for \"\"clarification of the wording of [the indictment which described the offense as] 'to injure, threaten and intimidate.'\"\" (emphasis added). this wording conflicted with the statute and the jury instructions which both described the offense in the disjunctive as, \"\"to injure, threaten or intimidate.\"\" (emphasis added). in response, the court informed the jury \"\"i have instructed you on the law, and you have your instructions.\"\" the jury convicted gary and james woodlee of all three counts of violent interference with federally protected rights but acquitted them of the conspiracy charge. mr. vandever, the driver of the other pickup, was acquitted of all charges. prior to sentencing, the woodlees filed written objections to their pre-sentence reports and filed motions for downward departure. in particular, they contested the court's use of the aggravated assault guideline and its failure to group the three counts. at the post-trial sentencing hearing, gary and james woodlee testified they had no knowledge mr. kinslow had a gun in the vehicle or that mr. kinslow was going to use it. in support of this contention, gary woodlee offered the results of a polygraph examination he had taken. after refusing to consider the polygraph evidence, the court overruled the woodlees' objections and denied their motions for downward departure. however, on its own motion, the court granted a two level reduction based on its desire to more closely align the woodlees' sentences with mr. kinslow's and its finding that the woodlees' conduct was \"\"single aberrant behavior.\"\" the court sentenced the woodlees to 78 months on each of the three counts to run concurrently. on his plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge, the court sentenced mr. kinslow to 70 months. this appeal followed. the woodlees' common appeals 1. insufficiency of the evidence both gary and james woodlee contend the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions. a jury's verdict must be upheld if \"\"after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\" jackson v. virginia , 443 u.s. 307, 319 , 99 s.ct. 2781, 2789 , 61 l.ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original); united states v. lane , 883 f.2d 1484, 1495 (10th cir.1989). we begin with 18 u.s.c. 245(b) which provides: to prove a felony conviction of this section, the government must show: (1) by use of force or threat of force; (2) the defendant willfully injured, intimidated or interfered with, or attempted to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person; (3) because of his race, color, religion or national origin; (4) because the person was, or had been, enjoying a public facility; and (5) bodily injury resulted. id. ; lane , 883 f.2d at 1495 ; united states v. makowski , 120 f.3d 1078, 1081 (9th cir.1997). the only element under contention here is whether bodily injury resulted. the woodlees concede there is sufficient evidence to support a misdemeanor conviction based on their intent to intimidate or interfere. however, they maintain there is insufficient evidence to sustain a felony conviction which specifically requires bodily injury. the woodlees argue, in essence, the government needed to show they intended to injure, not merely intended to intimidate or interfere with resulting injury. in support of their contention, the woodlees point to the jury's note to the judge. they argue the jury's hesitancy concerning the language, \"\"interfere, intimidate and injure,\"\" demonstrates the jury did not feel the woodlees intended injury. we believe this analysis misconstrues the statute. section 245(b) expressly provides the government need only show the defendants' illegal conduct resulted in bodily injury; not that the defendants intended bodily injury. as the government maintains, the standard \"\"is one of causation, not state of mind.\"\" this conclusion is supported by a long line of cases interpreting the phrase \"\"if death results\"\" under analogous statutes. see, e.g. , united states v. schwanke , 598 f.2d 575, 579 (10th cir.1979) (\"\"if death results\"\" under 18 u.s.c. 844(i) analogized to felony murder); united states v. piche , 981 f.2d 706, 711 (4th cir.1992) (\"\"'if death results' requires only that death foreseeably and naturally, rather than directly and intentionally, result [sic] from the rights-violating conduct\"\"); united states v. hayes , 589 f.2d 811, 821 (5th cir.1979) (\"\"no matter how you slice it, 'if death results' does not mean 'if death was intended. '\"\"); united states v. guillette , 547 f.2d 743, 749 (2d cir.1976) (\"\"we find the principle of proximate cause embodied in [18 u.s.c.] 241 through the phrase 'if death results.'\"\"). according to this analysis, the bodily injury element of the felony crime is satisfied if injury was a foreseeable result of the woodlees' intimidation or interference. in addition, the defendants need not have foreseen the actual injury that occurred; merely foreseeing some bodily injury is sufficient. united states v. dixon , 982 f.2d 116, 120 (3d cir.1992) (\"\"standard foreseeability analysis does not require [the defendant] to foresee the precise means the perpetrators he aided would use in [perpetrating the underlying offense].\"\"). here, the district court specifically held the defendants should have foreseen the resulting injuries. in particular, the court found: this finding is not erroneous. the defendants continuously taunted three black men in a bar when everyone involved was drinking. they had a nine millimeter gun in their possession, and one of them said he would use it. when the victims left, the woodlees chose to engage in a high speed car chase, again, while intoxicated. we believe, examining this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational jury could have found the government established the foreseeability of bodily injury beyond a reasonable doubt. 2. sentencing guidelines both woodlees contend the district court made numerous errors during sentencing including: (1) using the sentencing guideline for aggravated assault to determine the base offense level; (2) using the shooting as relevant conduct; (3) concluding mr. carter suffered serious bodily injury and enhancing the sentence accordingly; (4) failing to group each count together as a single group; and (5) failing to downward depart. we review the district court's interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo, while its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. united states v. havens , 910 f.2d 703, 704 (10th cir.1990). at sentencing, the court correctly referenced u.s.s.g. 2h1.1 for \"\"offenses involving individual rights.\"\" under this guideline, to establish the base offense level, the court must apply the greater of: u.s.s.g. 2h1.1 . the court applied subpart one and cross-referenced to 2a2.2, \"\"aggravated assault,\"\" as a guideline applicable to an underlying offense. the base offense level under 2a2.2 is 15. following this guideline, the court increased each count by five levels for mr. kinslow's discharge of a firearm. in addition, the court increased count 2, involving mr. carter, by four levels for serious bodily injury, and it increased counts 3 and 4 by two levels for bodily injury to the other two victims. the court then added three levels to each count under 3a1.1(a) because the defendants selected the victims on the basis of their race and adjusted for multiple counts by adding three levels to the highest offense level. finally, the court reduced two levels on its own motion because of the \"\"aberrant nature\"\" of the crime and to mitigate the disparity between the woodlees' sentences and that of mr. kinslow. this level provided a sentencing range of 78 to 97 months for each count. the court sentenced the woodlees to 78 months on each count to run concurrently. a. aggravated assault guideline the woodlees challenge the court's decision to cross-reference to the aggravated assault guideline. under 2h1.1, when determining a base offense level, the court must apply the greater of 12 or the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense. the sentencing guidelines define the phrase \"\"offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense\"\" as \"\"the offense guideline applicable to any conduct established by the offense of conviction that constitutes an offense under federal, state, or local law.\"\" u.s.s.g. 2h1.1 note 1 . the \"\"offense of conviction\"\" embodies \"\"the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted.\"\" u.s.s.g. 1b1.2(a) . the woodlees argue, because their conduct does not constitute the crime of aggravated assault under federal law or oklahoma state law, the court incorrectly referenced the aggravated assault guideline. in support of their contention, the woodlees note, under oklahoma law, an aggravated assault requires \"\"great bodily harm.\"\" okla. stat. tit. 21, 646 (1997) . here, it is undisputed the victims' injuries would not constitute great bodily harm under state law. accordingly, because their conduct does not specifically fall under the oklahoma statute entitled \"\"aggravated assault,\"\" the woodlees maintain application of the aggravated assault guideline was error. under the interpretation urged by the defendants, the sentencing guidelines' definition of aggravated assault would be wholly superfluous. in addition, the mere label a state ascribes to its crimes would govern what federal sentencing guideline a federal court is permitted to apply. we do not believe such a result is logical or necessary. the defendants' confusion arises from the mandate of 2h1.1 to cross-reference to a guideline \"\"applicable to any conduct established by the offense of conviction that constitutes an offense under federal, state, or local law.\"\" this definition directs a trial court to: (1) determine the conduct established by the offense of conviction; (2) refer to the appropriate state and federal law to determine what offense, if any, the conduct would establish under such law; and (3) if the court determines the conduct does constitute an offense under either state or federal law, the court must then refer to the guidelines' subpart concerning similar offenses. at this point, the sentencing guidelines' definitions aid the court in determining the appropriate guideline. applying this interpretation to the present case, we do not believe the court erred when it cross-referenced to the aggravated assault guideline. during sentencing, the district court made the following findings concerning the conduct established by the offense of conviction: the court clearly found the defendants committed a felonious assault with intent to do bodily harm involving a dangerous weapon. we do not believe the court erred; hence, the question becomes whether this conduct constitutes a crime under oklahoma or federal law. in oklahoma, an assault is defined as \"\"any willful and unlawful attempt or offer with force or violence to do a corporal hurt to another.\"\" okla. stat. tit. 21, 641 . the conduct, as the trial court established, clearly fits within this definition. accordingly, the conduct as established by the offense of conviction is an offense under oklahoma law--an assault. an \"\"assault\"\" leads us to the sentencing guidelines' chapter 2, part a, subpart 2. this subpart includes the guidelines' definition of \"\"aggravated assault\"\": \"\"a felonious assault that involved a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm ( i.e. , not merely to frighten) \"\" u.s.s.g. 2a2.2 note 1 . accordingly, we are left only with the question whether the woodlees' conduct conforms to the guidelines' definition of aggravated assault. the court's findings leave no doubt on this issue. we perceive no error. b. relevant conduct the woodlees contest the court's use of the shooting as relevant conduct in their sentencing. this argument tracks their argument for insufficiency of the evidence delineated above. in essence, they argue mr. kinslow's use of a firearm was not reasonably foreseeable and there was no evidence of an agreement that a firearm would be used; hence, mr. kinslow's use of a firearm is not relevant conduct. under the guidelines the court may consider as relevant conduct: u.s.s.g. 1b1.3(a)(1) . \"\"conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.\"\" id . at background . as we have already noted, the district court made specific findings concerning the woodlees' knowledge of the firearm. in addition to these findings, the court credited the testimony of mr. kinslow that \"\"he had been invited to accompany [the woodlees] as [they] pursued [the] victims leaving the tavern.\"\" this led the court to conclude, in furtherance of a plan his actions were reasonably foreseeable by you (emphasis added). the court did not err in these findings. the defendants racially taunted the victims repeatedly throughout the night. each had possession of a nine millimeter handgun, and gary woodlee said he \"\"would like to use it on them black son of a b s in the corner.\"\" finally, it strains credulity that the defendants, all crowded in the front seat of the pickup, did not know mr. kinslow had a rifle with a scope and twenty round clip. the shooting is relevant conduct. c. serious injury the woodlees received a four level serious injury enhancement for david carter's injuries. they argue the court erred when it applied this enhancement because the injuries in this case were not serious, and, at most, they should have received a two level enhancement for bodily injury. the woodlees maintain mr. carter's injuries were not serious because he merely received outpatient service lasting only 5-10 minutes. in addition, they argue, while mr. carter is experiencing some residual effects, his vision has not dropped outside the \"\"normal area.\"\" the district court did not agree. once again, the court did not err. the guidelines define serious bodily injury as \"\"injury involving extreme physical pain or the impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.\"\" u.s.s.g. 1b1.1 note j . in contrast, \"\"bodily injury\"\" is defined as \"\"any significant injury; e.g. , an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\"\" u.s.s.g. 1b1.1 note b . here, mr. carter needed surgery. although the surgery lasted only 5-10 minutes and was done on an outpatient basis, it was still surgery. there is no temporal limitation on seriousness stated or alluded to in the guidelines. in addition, mr. carter has residual damage which impairs a bodily organ--his eyes. either circumstance supports application of the serious bodily injury increase. d. grouping the woodlees were charged and convicted of three counts each alleging the same criminal conduct but against a different victim. they maintain the court erred when it failed to group all of the counts as a single group. the applicable guideline provides: u.s.s.g. 3d1.2 . this provision is meant to prevent \"\"'double counting' of offense behavior.\"\" id . note 5 . the woodlees maintain under subsection (c) the court should have grouped the three counts as one because \"\"both the counts in the indictment and the specific offense characteristics of 2a2.2 allege the same conduct, i.e., discharging a firearm.\"\" in essence, they argue the indictment charged them with discharging a firearm and the same conduct was used to enhance their sentence. this argument misconstrues the guideline. section 3d1.2(c) mandates grouping only \"\"[w]hen one of the counts embodies conduct applicable to another of the counts .\"\" here, although the woodlees received an enhancement for use of a firearm, discharge of a firearm was not a separate count against them. under the plain language of 3d1.2(c), grouping is not mandated. in comparison, discharge of a firearm was a separate count in the indictment against mr. kinslow. had he been convicted of all three counts and discharge of a firearm, then the guideline would mandate grouping. the same rationale does not apply to the woodlees, and the court did not err. e. downward departure finally, the woodlees assert error in the court's failure to depart downward. it is well established when the district court is aware of its authority to depart but does not exercise that authority, we do not have jurisdiction to review a district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward. united states v. rodriguez , 30 f.3d 1318, 1319 (10th cir.1994). the claim is without merit. b. james woodlee 1. 404(b) testimony during its case in chief, the government elicited testimony from a friend of james woodlee regarding mr. woodlee's racist attitudes. mr. woodlee maintains the court's admission of the testimony is contrary to fed.r.evid. 404(b) and constitutes reversible error. we review the district court's evidentiary decisions for an abuse of discretion. united states v. segien , 114 f.3d 1014, 1022 (10th cir.1997). rule 404(b) provides: evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is admissible under this rule if: united states v. herndon , 982 f.2d 1411, 1414 (10th cir.1992) (citing huddleston v. united states , 485 u.s. 681, 691-92 , 108 s.ct. 1496, 1502 , 99 l.ed.2d 771 (1988)). here, the government elicited testimony from terry gibson recounting a conversation between himself and james woodlee that took place approximately one week before the shooting. mr. gibson testified james woodlee planned to accompany some friends on an outing but, when mr. woodlee learned a woman of \"\"mixed race\"\" would also attend, he refused to go. mr. woodlee's counsel objected to the testimony and moved for a mistrial. later, during a conference on jury instructions, counsel again moved for a mistrial. finding the evidence relevant to show racial motive and intent, the court denied both motions choosing instead to instruct the jury: mr. woodlee argues the court erred by finding the evidence was offered for a proper purpose. in addition, he maintains any probative value was outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. we do not find either argument persuasive. to establish a felony conviction under 18 u.s.c. 245(b)(2)(f) , the government was required to prove mr. woodlee acted because of the victims' \"\"race, color, religion or national origin.\"\" evidence of past racial animosity is relevant to establish this element of the offense. accordingly, it falls squarely within the motive and intent purposes delineated in 404(b). in a similar case, united states v. franklin , 704 f.2d 1183 (10th cir.1983), we held the court's admission of evidence of a prior racially motivated act was not error. in franklin , the defendant murdered two black men while they jogged in a public park. he was charged with and convicted of two counts of violating 245(b)(2). at his trial, the prosecution sought to introduce evidence of the defendant's assault on an interracial couple four years earlier. we affirmed the district court's admission of the evidence. because 18 u.s.c. 245(b) id. at 1188 ; see also united states v. dunnaway , 88 f.3d 617, 619 (8th cir.1996) (\"\"because [defendant] was charged with a racially motivated crime, [ 245(b)(2)(b),] evidence of his racist views, behavior, and speech were [sic] relevant and admissible to show discriminatory purpose and intent, an element of the charges against him.\"\"). in this case, mr. woodlee is charged under the same general statute as the defendants in franklin and dunnaway , and the government bears the same burden. mr. woodlee does not, and indeed cannot, distinguish these cases. the evidence was admitted for a proper purpose. mr. woodlee's contention that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial tendencies is also without merit. a trial court has broad discretion to determine whether, under fed.r.evid. 403 , the probative value of evidence is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. see franklin , 704 f.2d at 1187 . in this case, the challenged evidence merely depicted mr. woodlee's refusal to attend an outing with friends; the evidence did not describe a prior crime. in addition, there was ample direct evidence of mr. woodlee's racial attitudes through direct testimony recounting his taunting on the night of the incident. we do not believe the court abused its discretion when it admitted the evidence. 2. brady james woodlee maintains the government's failure to reveal the victims had a gun constitutes reversible error under brady v. maryland , 373 u.s. 83 , 83 s.ct. 1194 , 10 l.ed.2d 215 (1963). \"\"to establish a brady violation, the defendant must establish: 1) that the prosecution suppressed evidence; 2) that the evidence was favorable to the accused; and 3) that the evidence was material.\"\" united states v. hughes , 33 f.3d 1248, 1251 (10th cir.1994). we review allegations of brady violations de novo. hughes , 33 f.3d at 1251 . during cross-examination of the government's first witness, david carter, the defense elicited testimony he had a nine millimeter pistol in his car the night of the shooting. mr. carter testified he never removed the pistol from his car prior to the shooting, never used the weapon, and the evidence showed none of the defendants knew he had the pistol. upon discovering the information, mr. woodlee moved for a mistrial. the court denied the motion, and mr. woodlee asserts error. we can find none. defendant's burden here is to show the \"\"evidence was favorable to the accused.\"\" id. however, mr. woodlee fails to make clear just how mr. carter's possession of a weapon is \"\"favorable\"\" to his defense. he asserts \"\"[t]he evidence is clearly favorable to the accused in that the alleged victims had access to the gun throughout the evening for their protection.\"\" however, in the absence of evidence indicating the defendants were aware of this fact, that argument is sophistry. at most, the evidence demonstrates mr. carter was scared and intimidated by the defendants and felt the need to protect himself. thus, if anything, the evidence tends to prove an element of the government's case, intimidation, rather than aid the defense. in any case, even if the evidence were exculpatory, we believe it is immaterial. evidence is material under brady when, had the evidence been disclosed, there is a reasonable probability of a different result at trial. kyles v. whitley , 514 u.s. 419, 433-34 , 115 s.ct. 1555, 1565-66 , 131 l.ed.2d 490 (1995). a reasonable probability of a different result is \"\"shown when the government's evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\"\" id. at 434 , 115 s.ct. at 1566 (citations and quotations omitted). when brady evidence is made available during the course of a trial, \"\"the materiality inquiry focuses on whether earlier disclosure would have created a reasonable doubt of guilt.\"\" united states v. young , 45 f.3d 1405, 1408 (10th cir.1995). here, the evidence was divulged with the first witness at trial, and each defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine every witness about the gun. if any defendant felt prejudiced, he could have sought a continuance; none did. finally, on this record, we do not believe earlier disclosure would have created a reasonable doubt whether james woodlee intimidated, interfered, or injured these victims. there is ample direct evidence of his guilt, the jury knew about the gun with the first witness, and the defense had a full opportunity to exploit the belatedly disclosed evidence. see, e.g. , united states v. rogers , 960 f.2d 1501, 1510 (10th cir.1992) (\"\"the brady rule is not violated when the material requested is made available during trial. \"\"); young , 45 f.3d at 1409 (\"\"when the abundance of evidence is combined with the fact that counsel was able to cross-examine [declarant] in rebuttal and the jury was able to hear and weigh the [evidence], we see no basis for concluding that the outcome of the trial could have been different if the [evidence] had been disclosed earlier.\"\"). we perceive no error. 3. the jencks act under the jencks act: 18 u.s.c. 3500(b) . violations of the jencks act are subject to harmless error analysis. young , 45 f.3d at 1409 . during the cross-examination of the first witness, david carter, defendants also learned for the first time mr. carter had made a fourteen page statement. the government asserted it did not know about the statement until the moment the defense uncovered its existence. in addition, during the cross-examination of brock lockhart, the third witness, defendants discovered he had made an undisclosed statement to the fbi. the government supplied both documents during mr. lockhart's cross-examination. james woodlee moved for a mistrial based on the jencks act violations. the court denied the motion but did make efforts to correct the error, offering defendants additional time to review the materials and the opportunity to recall any witnesses. james woodlee accepted the court's offer of additional time, and the court granted a recess. upon reconvening, the court explained to the jury the delay was \"\"occasioned by the fact that the government failed to turn over some things to the defendants they were supposed to.\"\" the defendants proceeded to cross-examine mr. lockhart concerning his and mr. carter's statements; however, no one attempted to recall mr. carter. at the close of the government's case, gary woodlee proposed admitting mr. carter's statement by stipulation to avoid a recall. the government agreed, and james woodlee did not object. the government violated the letter of the jencks act when it failed to disclose the two statements. however, because the defendant had the opportunity to immediately cross-examine mr. lockhart on his statement and, in fact, did so, we believe any error concerning his statement was harmless. see, e.g. , young , 45 f.3d at 1409 (\"\"in light of appellant's subsequent opportunity to cross-examine [declarant] about the statements, however, we must find that any error in this regard was harmless.\"\"). although mr. carter's statement presents a closer question, we do not believe james woodlee can prevail. mr. woodlee had the opportunity to recall mr. carter and chose not to do so. in addition, he did not object to the admission of the statement by stipulation. finally, mr. woodlee does not specifically identify any alleged prejudice suffered as a result of the violation, stating only \"\"[t]he government's failure to provide the statements was prejudicial to the defendants as they provided inconsistencies and omissions from the witnesses' testimony.\"\" under these circumstances, we conclude the government's failure to disclose the statement, while not laudable, was harmless. c. gary woodlee 1. polygraph at his sentencing, gary woodlee offered the results of a polygraph to corroborate his testimony he did not know mr. kinslow had a rifle or intended to use a rifle. the court refused to consider the polygraph evidence finding it to be wholly unreliable and irrelevant. because of the circumstances of this case, we need not consider whether the polygraph evidence should have been admitted. assuming error only for the sake of argument, however, we believe any error is harmless. see williams v. united states , 503 u.s. 193, 203 , 112 s.ct. 1112, 1120-21 , 117 l.ed.2d 341 (1992) (applying harmless error analysis to court's reliance on an invalid factor during sentencing). gary woodlee's proffered polygraph evidence focused only upon whether he saw mr. kinslow's rifle. 2 however, the critical issues for purposes of mr. woodlee's sentencing were: (1) whether he intended an injury; and (2) whether mr. kinslow's use of a firearm was foreseeable. the fact that mr. woodlee never saw the rifle is not dispositive of these issues. failure to see the rifle does not negate an intent to injure or negate foreseeability. mr. woodlee could have known mr. kinslow retrieved the gun from his car without actually seeing it. accordingly, assuming the court's failure to receive the evidence was error, the \"\"error did not affect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed\"\"; hence, it was harmless. id. d. mr. kinslow 1. hate crime mr. kinslow pled guilty to conspiracy to violate federal rights. his sentence of 70 months includes a three level enhancement for hate crime motivation. mr. kinslow only appeals the court's application of this enhancement, arguing: 1) the court did not apply the correct legal standard; and 2) the evidence does not support use of the enhancement. the guideline in question, u.s.s.g. 3a1.1(a), provides for a three level enhancement when the court \"\"determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim as the object of the offense because of the actual or perceived race of any person.\"\" mr. kinslow maintains the court incorrectly applied a preponderance standard instead of the required reasonable doubt standard. in support of this contention, he notes 3a1.1(b), directly below the operative section, only requires a preponderance standard. 3 the court made these findings and conclusions during the sentencing: while this finding does not mirror the language of the guideline, we believe it sufficiently states the court's position. clearly, the court found the victims were chosen because of their race and mr. kinslow knew this fact. by aiding and abetting the continuing crime, mr. kinslow must have also made the same choice. this conclusion is supported by the fact mr. kinslow pled guilty to an indictment charging him with racial discrimination. count 1 of the indictment reads: without discrimination on account of race or color (emphasis added). mr. kinslow's guilty plea thus necessarily includes an admission that he agreed to interfere with the victims because of their race. in addition, each of the substantive crimes underlying the conspiracy required a showing of racial motivation. the court did not err. finally, mr. kinslow argues, even if the court applied the correct standard, the facts do not support use of the enhancement because he did not \"\"select\"\" any victim. the record reflects that, while in the bar, mr. kinslow did not participate in any of the racial taunting. instead, he sat at the opposite side of the bar from the other defendants and consumed beer. when the bartender closed the bar, mr. kinslow walked to his car in the parking lot. as he got into his car, gary woodlee pulled up in his truck and \"\"directed mr. kinslow to get into their truck.\"\" mr. kinslow grabbed his gun and joined the woodlees. this evidence, maintains mr. kinslow, demonstrates he \"\"played no role in the selection of the victims but joined the offense only toward the conclusion of a crime already in progress.\"\" we, like the district court, believe this argument strains the obvious. it is inconceivable mr. kinslow did not \"\"select\"\" his victims because of their race. mr. kinslow sat in a bar where three black men were racially taunted throughout the night. the three men did not retaliate in any fashion. the only logical reason to chase and shoot at these men was their race. we do not believe simply because the other defendants made the initial decision whom to taunt mr. kinslow is relieved of his choice to join in the melee. the facts demonstrate he chose to point and fire a rifle at a car with three people in it because of the color of their skin. mr. kinslow offers no alternative reason for his choice to shoot into that car. the court's appl                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>0.399229486516014   </td></tr>\n",

making two false reports to braniff airlines claiming his ex-wife's suitor was aboard a braniff plane carrying a handgun and explosives. mr. norman was charged with two counts of violating 49 u.s.c.app. 1472(m) (imparting false information regarding firearms and explosives aboard an aircraft). because there is no specific sentencing guideline for violation of 1472(m) , the district court applied the guideline for the offense of making threatening communications. the court also refused to group the two counts for sentencing purposes. we conclude the guideline which should have been applied is that for the offense of possessing dangerous weapons or materials while boarding an aircraft. we also conclude the two counts should have been grouped. we therefore reverse and remand for resentencing. on october 7, 1988, mr. norman anonymously telephoned braniff airlines and told them mike benkowsky was aboard a plane in route from san diego to kansas city and that he was carrying a handgun and explosives. although airport security police attempted to detain mr. benkowsky, the plane had already landed, and they were unable to locate him. mr. norman made a second anonymous call to braniff and reported mr. benkowsky would be leaving kansas city for san diego armed with explosives. at 9:55 a.m. on october 9, a braniff flight left kansas city for san diego. while that flight was in the air, braniff received another call stating a dangerous felon was aboard with explosives. noting mr. benkowsky had purchased a ticket on that flight, braniff officials ordered the plane to return to kansas city where the passengers were removed and the baggage searched. mr. benkowsky was not aboard the plane. because no explosives were found, the flight was resumed. braniff had a second flight to san diego later that day. as the plane was preparing to take off, it was stopped by airport security. this time, the officers found mr. benkowsky and removed him from the plane in handcuffs. after questioning him, the officers released mr. benkowsky, and he returned to california. authorities discovered mr. norman's role in these events, and ultimately he was charged with two counts of violating 49 u.s.c.app. 1472(m) , to which he entered pleas of guilty. defendant readily admitted his guilt to the presentence investigator, advising him he made the calls because his former wife had entered a relationship with mr. benkowsky. we must determine whether the district court correctly applied the guidelines, given there is no specific provision for the offense to which mr. norman pled. application of the guidelines is reviewed for errors of law de novo , united states v. banashefski , 928 f.2d 349, 351 (10th cir.1991). when the issue cannot be resolved by a plain reading of the guideline in question, we will look to the commentary and supplemental illustrations for guidance. id. when a charge is not covered by the guidelines, the court must apply \"\"the most analogous offense guideline.\"\" united states sentencing guidelines 2x5.1 . although mr. norman pled guilty to two counts of violating 1472(m) , there is no sentencing guideline for that crime. thus the district court was bound to find the most analogous offense upon which to base the sentence. in this instance, over the defendant's objection, the court chose to apply the guideline for the crime of \"\"threatening communications,\"\" u.s.s.g. 2a6.1 . despite the apparent similarity in the title of the statute defining the underlying crime, the substantive offense of making threatening communications has no statutory parallel to the offense of which mr. norman was convicted. the offense of threatening communications, codified in 18 u.s.c. 871 , 876, 877, 878(a), and 879, is committed by making threats against a president, using the mail to make threats, making threats against foreign dignitaries and officials, and making threats against a former president. mr. norman's criminal conduct does not implicate any of these crimes. a closer parallel exists, however, between his conduct and the offense of \"\"[c]arrying weapons, loaded firearms, and explosives aboard an aircraft,\"\" 49 u.s.c.app. 1472(l) , to which u.s.s.g. 2k1.5 specifically applies. not only is there a factual parallel between the act of carrying a loaded firearm or explosive aboard an aircraft and mr. norman's criminal act, there is also a statutory affinity between the two offenses. section 1472(m) provides: imparts or conveys false information concerning an attempt to do any act which would be a felony prohibited by subsection (i), (j), (k), or (l) of this section (emphasis added). section 1472(l) , included within 1472(m) , criminalizes carrying weapons aboard an aircraft. the false information conveyed by mr. norman was that mr. benkowsky was carrying a weapon and an explosive aboard an airliner. because of these factual and statutory parallels, we believe mr. norman's threats are more analogous to carrying a weapon aboard a plane than to making a threat against a president, foreign dignitary, or by use of the mails. thus, guideline 2k1.5 , which provides the base offense level for carrying weapons aboard an aircraft is the most analogous guideline for sentencing a violation of 1472(m) . 1 having concluded the district court erred in applying 2a6.1 , we must consider whether mr. norman is correct that the counts should be grouped for sentencing. guideline 3d1.2 provides: the district court did not apply 3d1.2 because it specifically excludes \"\"all offenses in chapter two, part a.\"\" thus, because the court applied 2a6.1 , it was logical for the court to deny defendant's request for grouping. the district court's reasoning is no longer applicable, however. therefore, we must review the facts and determine whether they fit within the confines of 3d1.2(b) . in doing so, we are mindful of application note 4 to 3d1.2(b) which states in part: \"\"[s]ubsection (b) provides that counts that are part of a single course of conduct with a single criminal objective and represent essentially one composite harm to the same victim are to be grouped together, even if they constitute legally distinct offenses occurring at different times.\"\" (emphasis added). the government argues grouping is not proper because the acts upon which the conviction is based \"\"occurred on two separate dates, and involved separate instances of fear and risk of harm, and therefore, are not one composite harm.\"\" contending that braniff airlines was the \"\"primary victim\"\" of defendant's \"\"terrorist threats,\"\" the government urges mr. norman's acts constituted separate risk of harm and fear to \"\"different flights, crews and passengers.\"\" the government relegates mr. benkowsky to the role of \"\"secondary victim.\"\" our analysis leads us to the opposite conclusion. the scheme defendant carried out was motivated by only one desire: to bring grief to mr. benkowsky. while the method employed was bizarre, it was surely motivated by mr. norman's assumption that immediate and severe consequences would befall mr. benkowsky if he were perceived as a threat to the airplane and its passengers. the scenario in the record indicates braniff was merely a tool in mr. norman's criminal scheme. mr. norman did not target the airline for harm. indeed, it may be logically assumed that had mr. benkowsky chosen another carrier for his trip, that airline would have become the means by which the defendant visited his mischief upon his victim. 2 contrary to the government's position, we think this case is like united states v. wilson , 920 f.2d 1290 (6th cir.1990), in which the defendant made five long distance telephone calls over a period of two weeks to obtain a \"\"hit man\"\" to murder his wife. at the end of the two weeks, the defendant mailed a letter containing a $500 down payment to secure the deal. these transactions resulted in an indictment containing six counts of using an interstate commerce facility to attempt to have his wife murdered. the sixth circuit reversed the trial court's refusal to group the counts under 3d1.3(b) . the court held: id. at 1294 (citation omitted). similarly, the calls placed by mr. norman, albeit on separate dates, are still connected to his criminal objective of bringing harm to mr. benkowsky. in that vein, the sixth circuit stated: section 3d1.2 id. we therefore conclude there was only one course of conduct (making false reports to braniff), only one criminal objective (to harm mr. benkowsky), and only one composite harm to one victim (subjecting mr. benkowsky to arrest). we hold mr. norman's offenses should have been grouped. the sentences are vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing in accordan

court for the district of kansas on five counts of distributing heroin in violation of 21 u.s.c. 841(a)(1) and 18 u.s.c. 2 , one count of possession of heroin with intent to sell in violation of 21 u.s.c. 841(a)(1) and 18 u.s.c. 2 , and one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of 21 u.s.c. 841(a)(1) and 21 u.s.c. 846 . the sole issue in this appeal is whether entrapment, as a matter of law, exists. mr. dozal appeals, claiming government agents induced him to commit the unlawful activity and the evidence produced at trial is insufficient as a matter of law to show he was predisposed to commit the offenses. the jury rejected defendant's entrapment defense and our review of the entire record convinces us the evidence clearly supports the verdicts. accordingly, we affirm. in february 1990, mr. dozal developed a friendship with a musician named tony fardella who agreed to help promote defendant's music career. unbeknownst to mr. dozal, however, mr. fardella served as an informant for the drug enforcement agency (dea). 1 mr. fardella soon told the dea about a conversation he had with mr. dozal where he inquired whether mr. dozal knew anyone willing to front him cocaine. mr. fardella testified that mr. dozal responded negatively, but indicated he was \"\"trying to move some heroin.\"\" mr. fardella took undercover dea agent jim woods to mr. dozal's home on april 12, 1990, to purchase some heroin. agent woods posed as a heroin dealer seeking a supply source for further distribution. when they first arrived mr. dozal was alone but stated he was waiting for a \"\"very old friend.\"\" shortly thereafter, a man named reynaldo rodrigez arrived. 2 during this first meeting mr. dozal made agent woods \"\"swear to god that [he] was not a cop.\"\" within two minutes of the encounter mr. dozal began negotiating the price of the heroin with agent woods, who was able to haggle the cost down from $2,300 to $2,200 per ounce. agent woods handed mr. rodrigez the money and he, in turn, handed the agent one ounce of brown mexican heroin. before agent woods left, he and mr. dozal agreed on specific \"\"code\"\" words to use when describing heroin in future telephone conversations. mr. dozal also agreed the price for future heroin buys would drop to $2,100 per ounce. mr. rodrigez gave mr. dozal $60 for his services in this transaction. agent woods telephoned mr. dozal three times to arrange purchases of heroin and mr. dozal invited him to his residence on at least one occasion. transactions similar to the initial buy, but involving larger quantities of heroin, occurred at mr. dozal's residence on april 18, april 23, and again on april 30, 1990. all three times, mr. rodrigez handed agent woods heroin in exchange for cash. mr. dozal was present at each deal and continued to negotiate the price with agent woods. he indicated if ten ounce shipments were purchased the price would drop to $1950 per ounce. at one point agent woods inquired whether mr. dozal would be interested in swapping cocaine for heroin. mr. dozal responded by saying he would have to talk it over with mr. rodrigez. following the buy on april 30th, agent woods discovered he had been shorted nearly one quarter ounce of heroin. he telephoned mr. dozal four times about the shortage and met with him at his residence. mr. dozal assured the agent that mr. rodrigez would correct the deficiency and offered to pay for the shortage himself. mr. dozal was visibly upset since he thought he had been \"\"followed\"\" after the previous day's transaction and because agent woods had used the word \"\"gram\"\" over the telephone. agent woods went to mr. dozal's residence again on tuesday, may 8, 1990, this time to arrange purchase of six ounces of heroin. mr. dozal appeared \"\"paranoid.\"\" believing his house was bugged with transmitters, mr. dozal led the agent to a utility room he thought was safe. he searched agent woods for electronic transmitters and again made him swear he was not a law enforcement officer. mr. dozal then agreed the transaction with mr. rodrigez would take place the following day. agent woods met both individuals at mr. dozal's house on wednesday as planned. mr. dozal promptly went to the garage, returned with a cup and placed it in front of mr. rodrigez. mr. rodrigez pulled a baggie containing heroin out of the cup and tossed it to agent woods, saying \"\"[t]hat's your shortage.\"\" agent woods weighed the plastic bag on electronic scales and mr. rodrigez handed him several more baggies containing six ounces of heroin. agent woods then stated he needed to go to his car to retrieve the $12,000. mr. dozal initially objected to the agent leaving the house with the heroin but then acquiesced, saying \"\"go ahead and get the money and bring it back in.\"\" agent woods did not return. instead, three other dea agents entered the house and arrested the pair. at trial, mr. dozal admitted the elements of the offenses but claimed the government entrapped him. a jury rejected the entrapment defense after a four day trial and the district court sentenced mr. dozal to five years imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. discussion mr. dozal contends the dea initiated each of the illegal transactions and the government failed to show that he was predisposed to commit the offenses. in short, he argues the government brought forth no evidence other than his vulnerability to be \"\"induced into the drug world by a mercenary.\"\" mr. dozal asserts \"\"vulnerability\"\" does not equate to predisposition and had the dea not induced him to arrange the drug purchases he would have remained \"\"a poor and struggling, but law abiding, musician.\"\" of immediate importance, mr. dozal asserts that whether sufficient evidence exists to constitute a triable issue of entrapment is a question of law, reviewable de novo by the court of appeals. while this statement is technically correct on its face, mr. dozal misconstrues its applicability to the present situation. for example, much of the support cited by mr. dozal goes to the threshold inquiry of whether the trial court should allow an entrapment defense in the first instance; it bears little relevance to the proper standard of review this court should accord a jury's findings of fact on the issue. here, the trial court delivered, without objection, nearly the identical entrapment instruction requested by mr. dozal's counsel. because the trial court submitted the entrapment defense to the jury essentially as requested by mr. dozal, we need not consider whether a triable issue of entrapment exists. however, we have examined mr. dozal's claim that the evidence supports a finding of entrapment as a matter of law. we \"\"may find entrapment as a matter of law if the evidence satisfying the essential elements of entrapment is 'uncontradicted.'\"\" united states v. price , 945 f.2d 331, 332 (10th cir.1991) (citations omitted). in other words, entrapment as a matter of law exists \"\"'only when there is undisputed testimony which shows conclusively and unmistakably that an otherwise innocent person was induced to commit the act.'\"\" united states v. fadel , 844 f.2d 1425, 1434 (10th cir.1988) (quoting united states v. gurule , 522 f.2d 20 (10th cir.1975), cert. denied , 425 u.s. 976 , 96 s.ct. 2177 , 48 l.ed.2d 800 (1976)). our search of the record reveals sufficient disputed testimony arose at trial to preclude a finding that mr. dozal was entrapped as a matter of law. for instance, mr. dozal's testimony contradicts mr. fardella's assertion that the defendant, not the dea, actively sought out a buyer for heroin. this confutation alone forestalls the need for further inquiry. defendant carries a heavy burden in attempting to persuade an appellate court he has been entrapped as a matter of law, and for good reason. where a properly instructed jury considers the entrapment defense, the matter becomes so intertwined with the issue of intent and so \"\"typically based upon credibility determinations, [that it remains] an area traditionally reserved for jury resolution.\"\" fadel , 844 f.2d at 1430 ; see also united states v. riles , 928 f.2d 339, 342 (10th cir.1991) (\"\"entrapment is an affirmative defense, which bears on the question whether a defendant is guilty of the crime charged [and] can only be resolved by trial of the general issue.\"\" (citations omitted. )); united states v. sullivan , 919 f.2d 1403, 1418 (10th cir.1990) (when the trial court is convinced a genuine issue of entrapment exists, the matter becomes a question of fact for the jury). we generally will not supplant our judgment for that of the fact finder where it has resolved the matter. the fact finder is traditionally in the best position to evaluate the evidence and determine credibility. here, especially, the jury not only observed the testimony of the witnesses, but also heard the taped recordings of the actual meetings between agent woods and mr. dozal. because the jury held as a matter of fact that mr. dozal was not entrapped into distributing heroin, \"\"it would be anomalous for us to now hold that there was entrapment as a matter of law.\"\" price , 945 f.2d at 332 . such a determination that entrapment was established as a matter of law can, however, be made in circumstances where the holding should be made without choosing between conflicting witnesses nor judging credibility. sherman v. united states , 356 u.s. 369, 373 , 78 s.ct. 819, 821 , 2 l.ed.2d 848 (1958) (entrapment held established from undisputed testimony of prosecution witnesses). such is not the case here. accordingly, we review only whether sufficient evidence exists to support the jury's verdict. see united states v. hooks , 780 f.2d 1526, 1531 (10th cir.), cert. denied , 475 u.s. 1128 , 106 s.ct. 1657 , 90 l.ed.2d 199 (1986). a single test applies, whether the evidence relied upon is direct or circumstantial. the evidence, \"\"together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom--is sufficient if, when taken in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\" id. we have examined the entire record and find the evidence sufficient to sustain mr. dozal's convictions. the purpose underlying the entrapment defense is to protect an otherwise unpredisposed individual from government coercion. united states v. ortiz , 804 f.2d 1161, 1165 (10th cir.1986). the critical inquiry in entrapment, therefore, focuses on defendant's intent or predisposition to commit the offense rather than the degree of government involvement. see hampton v. united states , 425 u.s. 484, 488 , 96 s.ct. 1646, 1649 , 48 l.ed.2d 113 (1976); fadel , 844 f.2d at 1433 ; ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . only when the government deceives the defendant in such a way as to \"\"actually implant[ ] the criminal design\"\" in the defendant's mind does entrapment come into play. hampton , 425 u.s. at 489 , 96 s.ct. at 1649 . the central question, therefore, is whether the criminal intent originated with the defendant or with the government agents. ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . \"\"predisposition\"\" is defined as a defendant's inclination, willingness or readiness to engage in the illegal activity for which he has been charged. ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . here, the focus centers on the defendant's state of mind before government agents suggest illegal activity. id. predisposition may arise from direct evidence of defendant's prior involvement in the illegal activity, id. , or may be inferred from \"\"defendant's desire for profit, his eagerness to participate in the transaction, his ready response to the government's inducement offer, or his demonstrated knowledge or experience in the criminal activity under investigation.\"\" fadel , 844 f.2d at 1433 . suffice it to say, \"\"a defendant asserting an entrapment defense opens himself to a 'searching inquiry.'\"\" id. (citation omitted). at the outset, we find the distinction between vulnerability and predisposition a matter of degree, not kind. the point at which an otherwise innocent person succumbs to an inherent willingness to participate in unlawful behavior, therefore, remains largely a factual issue. the record here indicates mr. dozal's role in the sale of heroin was significant. the evidence, taken as a whole, reveals mr. dozal as a willing and cooperative middleman in five heroin transactions, not the unwilling dupe he would have us believe. first, the evidence shows mr. dozal desired to profit from the transactions. he received $60 for his role the first exchange and a total of $200 for all five transactions. agent woods testified that after his arrest mr. dozal told him he was just trying to make some money and he did not see anything wrong with selling heroin. \"\"it wasn't like i was killing anyone,\"\" agent woods quoted mr. dozal as saying. additionally, mr. dozal admits on appeal that \"\"[t]o get fardella to help him with his music career, he started looking for somebody to front fardella cocaine.\"\" all this evidence represents an indicia of profit motive. likewise, mr. dozal displayed an eagerness to participate in the heroin transactions, which relates directly to the issue of predisposition. according to a government witness it was mr. dozal, not the dea, who first suggested he had heroin to sell. later, mr. dozal actively located mr. rodrigez as the supplier. he arranged the initial meeting between mr. rodrigez and mr. fardella to discuss drugs at a restaurant where he performed and later arranged a similar meeting between mr. rodrigez and agent woods at his residence. in all, he hosted five separate heroin transactions in his home and served as the primary negotiator of the price. similarly, mr. dozal was quick to respond to the undercover agents' inquiries about purchasing drugs. he told mr. fardella at their initial introduction he was trying to move some heroin and asked if he was interested. he also admitted attempting to find a cocaine source for fardella. again, a jury could properly consider this evidence as to mr. dozal's predisposition. mr. dozal also demonstrated substantial knowledge of the drug trade and the evidence strongly implicates him in the illicit activity. for instance, mr. dozal inquired whether agent woods was a law enforcement officer on several occasions and once searched him for a transmitter. he was acutely aware of the prevailing prices of heroin and openly negotiated the price with agent woods. mr. dozal also arranged to speak in code and conducted several transactions in his utility room where he thought it was safe from electronic bugs. he offered to pay agent woods for the shortage that occurred during the second buy on april 30. he became upset and paranoid when agent woods used the word \"\"gram\"\" on the telephone. finally, on the morning of the arrest, it was mr. dozal who initially insisted agent woods not leave the house with the heroin until he turned over the $12,000. in the final analysis, all of this evidence is consistent with a predisposition to take part in the sale of heroin. however, mr. dozal still insists that agents induced him to participate in the narcotics trade and the government failed to show any prior history of his involvement in drugs. mr. dozal's arguments have little merit. \"\"inducement\"\" is defined as \"\"'government conduct which creates a substantial risk that an undisposed person or otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit the offense.'\"\" sullivan , 919 f.2d at 1418 (quoting ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 ). therefore, our inquiry focuses on whether the defendant stood eager or reluctant to participate in the charged criminal conduct. ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . inducement may take the form of \"\"'\"\"persuasion, fraudulent representations, threats, coercive tactics, harassment, promises of reward, or pleas based on need, sympathy or friendship.\"\"'\"\" sullivan , 919 f.2d at 1418 (quoting ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 ). evidence that a government agent approached, solicited or requested the defendant \"\"to engage in criminal conduct, standing alone, is insufficient to constitute inducement.\"\" ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . nor will inducement arise from evidence the government initiated the contact, id. , or assisted in the unlawful activity, fadel , 844 f.2d at 1433 . it is also well established that in narcotics enforcement, officers may employ appropriate artifice and deception to uncover illicit activities. united states v. jobe , 487 f.2d 268, 270 (10th cir.1973), cert. denied , 416 u.s. 955 , 94 s.ct. 1968 , 40 l.ed.2d 305 (1974). merely providing a person \"\"ready and willing to violate the law\"\" an opportunity to engage in the illegal acts is not entrapment. id. in short, entrapment is a \"\"relatively limited defense.\"\" fadel , 844 f.2d at 1429 (quoting united states v. russell , 411 u.s. 423, 435 , 93 s.ct. 1637, 1644 , 36 l.ed.2d 366 (1973)). just as an accused seeking to raise the defense need only produce sufficient evidence to create a factual issue, id. at 1430 , the government need only generate \"\"sufficient independent evidence of predisposition to present a jury question,\"\" id. at 1434 . the burden is not upon the government to produce absolute proof of predisposition, but rather it need only convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal intent originated with the defendant. ortiz , 804 f.2d at 1165 . furthermore, in rebutting an entrapment defense, \"\"the government is not required to show that the defendant has engaged in prior acts or prior violations of the narcotics laws.\"\" fadel , 844 f.2d at 1433 . sufficient evidence appears in this record to find mr. dozal was a ready and willing participant in the sale of heroin, particularly where he initiated the heroin deals by asking the government informant if he was interested in purchasing heroin. hence, it was mr. dozal, no

corpus filed pursuant to 28 u.s.c. 2254. 1 we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c. 1291 and 2253 2 and affirm. i on the night of march 15, 1982, the griswold trading post, operated by the griswold family and located within the exterior boundaries of the navajo reservation, was robbed by three men and one woman. to effectuate the robbery, the griswolds were accosted in their home across the street where three of them were tied up at gunpoint. mr. griswold was then escorted to the store where he opened the safe. the robbers took almost $10,000. scrivner was not at the scene and was never identified by any of the victims as one of the assailants. however, one identified assailant, william johnson, admitted the robbery and informed investigators that scrivner talked over the plans before the robbery with \"\"preacher,\"\" one participant. roa vol. ii, trial tr. at 151, 154-55, 158. johnson said that scrivner did not participate in the robbery but drove the people out there and waited in the van until the robbery had been committed. id. at 155. johnson was the only prosecution witness at scrivner's trial who identified scrivner as a participant in the crime. the only physical evidence presented at trial which linked scrivner to the robbery was two walkie-talkies. scrivner's business partner, cliff harper, testified scrivner had told him he had the walkie-talkies. id. at 278. mr. griswold testified that the robbers used a walkie-talkie to communicate with another party, id. at 35, who was identified by johnson as scrivner, who acted as the lookout, id. at 81. mrs. griswold testified scrivner had been in the store for a few minutes three days before the robbery and had left without purchasing anything. id. at 26. scrivner did not deny that his van, which was used as the shop van, id. at 233-34, was at the scene. scrivner stated he had loaned the van to johnson, and johnson said he wanted to move some furniture. id. at 232-33. the jury convicted scrivner of one count of armed robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, one count of kidnapping, and three counts of false imprisonment. he was sentenced to two consecutive ten-year terms of imprisonment plus two years' parole on counts i and iii. 3 sentences on the other counts were imposed to run concurrently with the two ten-year terms. the new mexico court of appeals affirmed scrivner's conviction and the new mexico supreme court denied certiorari. scrivner later filed state petitions for habeas corpus which were denied. respondent admits scrivner has exhausted his state court remedies and is not procedurally barred from raising any of the issues identified in his current federal petition. 4 in his federal habeas petition, scrivner raised six issues. he alleged (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; (2) his due process rights were violated by prosecution references to other crimes; (3) his right to present mitigating evidence was denied because he was sentenced immediately after the trial; (4) the state court lacked jurisdiction over him because he is a native american and the offenses were committed on the reservation; (5) the state court lacked jurisdiction to try him because he was arrested in arizona by new mexico authorities who had no arrest warrant; and (6) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel did not raise the jurisdictional issue of his native american ancestry to the trial court. on appeal, scrivner additionally argues the district court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his due process rights were violated when the state trial court denied his motion for a continuance of the sentencing hearing. ii \"\"[f]ederal habeas courts sit to ensure that individuals are not imprisoned in violation of the constitution--not to correct errors of fact.\"\" herrera v. collins , 506 u.s. 390 , , 113 s.ct. 853, 860 , 122 l.ed.2d 203 (1993). further, \"\"it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state court determinations on state law questions.\"\" estelle v. mcguire , 502 u.s. 62, 67-68 , 112 s.ct. 475, 480 , 116 l.ed.2d 385 (1991). thus, in federal habeas proceedings we review conclusions of law de novo , while granting a presumption of correctness to the state court's factual findings unless they are not fairly supported by the record. hatch v. oklahoma , 58 f.3d 1447, 1453 (10th cir.1995). in this circuit, we review mixed questions of law and fact de novo . id. ; but see wright v. west , 505 u.s. 277, 294-95 , 112 s.ct. 2482, 2491-92 , 120 l.ed.2d 225 (1992) (declining to announce a standard for habeas review of the state court's application of the law to the facts). scrivner argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the evidence against him consisted solely of uncorroborated and inherently incredible accomplice testimony. he asserts the evidence that the business walkie-talkies were used in the robbery was not corroborating because anyone could have had access to the walkie-talkies. in reviewing a claim questioning the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, \"\"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\" jackson v. virginia , 443 u.s. 307, 318-19 , 99 s.ct. 2781, 2789 , 61 l.ed.2d 560 (1979). \"\"'to be sufficient, the evidence supporting the conviction must be substantial; that is, it must do more than raise a mere suspicion of guilt.'\"\" kelly v. roberts , 998 f.2d 802, 808 (10th cir.1993) (quoting beachum v. tansy , 903 f.2d 1321, 1332 (10th cir.), cert. denied , 498 u.s. 904 , 111 s.ct. 269 , 112 l.ed.2d 225 (1990)). this court has observed that the assumption that the testimony of an accomplice should seldom, if ever, be believed is not the law because it is the province of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses. united states v. torres , 53 f.3d 1129, 1140 (10th cir.), cert. denied sub nom . aflleje-torres v. united states , u.s. , 115 s.ct. 2599 , 132 l.ed.2d 845 (1995), and u.s. , 116 s.ct. 220 , 133 l.ed.2d 150 (1995). \"\"[a] jury may convict based on the uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator\"\" so long as the testimony is not incredible on its face and is otherwise capable of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. id. while in torres , a direct criminal appeal, we held that a conviction based on accomplice testimony may be affirmed if the jury was properly instructed that such \"\"testimony must be carefully scrutinized, weighed with great care, and received with caution,\"\" id. (citations omitted), that holding does not control here because that holding was not imposed as a constitutional requirement. the constitution does not prohibit convictions based primarily on accomplice testimony. see takacs v. engle , 768 f.2d 122, 127 (6th cir.1985) (\"\"the constitution says nothing about accomplice testimony. \"\"); cf. harrington v. nix , 983 f.2d 872, 874 (8th cir.1993) (\"\"[s]tate laws requiring corroboration do not implicate constitutional concerns that can be addressed on habeas review. \"\"); llewellyn v. stynchcombe , 609 f.2d 194, 196 (5th cir.1980) (state law requiring independent corroboration of accomplice testimony not controlling on collateral review by federal court). scrivner's alibi testimony as presented by various witnesses was contradictory. scrivner points out that some of johnson's testimony also varied from statements he had made earlier. the weight to be given johnson's testimony and scrivner's alibi testimony depends on the credibility given to the witnesses' testimony--a determination reserved to the jury. torres , 53 f.3d at 1140 . by his testimony, johnson incriminated himself as well as scrivner. while the adverse effect on johnson's own penal interest is not dispositive, it is one factor entitled to some consideration. see united states v. gomez , 810 f.2d 947, 954 & n. 8 (10th cir.), cert. denied , 482 u.s. 908 , 107 s.ct. 2488 , 96 l.ed.2d 379 (1987). upon consideration of these factors and our review of the record, we are convinced that johnson's testimony was sufficient, and was sufficiently corroborated by physical evidence, so that a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crimes charged against scrivner beyond a reasonable doubt. iii scrivner next argues his due process rights were violated because, while testifying, johnson made several references to other crimes he had been involved in with scrivner. our responsibility here is to ensure only that scrivner \"\"was afforded the protections of due process, not to exercise supervisory powers over the new mexico state courts.\"\" nichols v. sullivan , 867 f.2d 1250, 1253 (10th cir.), cert. denied , 490 u.s. 1112 , 109 s.ct. 3169 , 104 l.ed.2d 1031 (1989). to prevail on this argument, scrivner must show johnson's remarks were \"\"so prejudicial in the context of the proceedings as a whole that he was deprived of the fundamental fairness essential to the concept of due process.\"\" id. ; see also hopkinson v. shillinger , 866 f.2d 1185, 1197 (10th cir.1989) (\"\"[w]e will not disturb a state court's admission of evidence of prior crimes, wrongs or acts unless the probative value of such evidence is so greatly outweighed by the prejudice flowing from its admission that the admission denies defendant due process of law.\"\"). we cannot say any constitutional error occurred. johnson's statements were unsolicited, see united states v. copeland , 51 f.3d 611, 616 (6th cir.1995) (government is not responsible for unsolicited remarks), cert. denied , u.s. , 116 s.ct. 199 , 133 l.ed.2d 133 (1995), although the prosecution did once invite further explanation of johnson's statement. at that point, the court admonished the prosecution and the question was withdrawn. roa vol. ii, trial tr. at 54. after other remarks were made, the court instructed the jury to disregard them. id. at 57-58, 93. even if we were to conclude the references to other crimes was error, we would hold the error to be harmless. in a federal habeas case, the harmless error standard announced in kotteakos v. united states , 328 u.s. 750, 776 , 66 s.ct. 1239, 1253 , 90 l.ed. 1557 (1946), would govern here, i.e., whether the error substantially and injuriously influenced the jury's verdict. see tuttle v. utah , 57 f.3d 879, 883 (10th cir.1995). in light of the entire record and looking at the totality of the evidence presented, id. at 884 , we have no \"\"grave doubt\"\" that the error complained of here was harmless, id. iv scrivner next asserts his right to present mitigating evidence was denied because he was sentenced immediately after trial and because of the court's denial of counsel's motion for a continuance. for scrivner to prevail on this issue, he must show he had a federal constitutional right to present mitigating evidence at sentencing. cf. jackson v. ylst , 921 f.2d 882, 885 (9th cir.1990) (to prevail on federal habeas, petitioner must demonstrate violation of his constitutional or other federal right). a trial court's failure to afford a defendant the right of allocution raises neither a jurisdictional nor a constitutional error cognizable in habeas. 5 hill v. united states , 368 u.s. 424, 428 , 82 s.ct. 468, 471 , 7 l.ed.2d 417 (1962); see also segura v. patterson , 402 f.2d 249, 252-53 (10th cir.1968), rev'd on other grounds , 403 u.s. 946 , 91 s.ct. 2280 , 29 l.ed.2d 856 (1971). the supreme court's opinions have repeatedly suggested that there is no comparable requirement outside the capital context for an individualized sentencing doctrine. see harmelin v. michigan , 501 u.s. 957, 995 , 111 s.ct. 2680, 2701-02 , 115 l.ed.2d 836 (1991). similarly, no violation of a petitioner's eighth amendment or due process or equal protection rights occurs when the trial court does not consider mitigating factors during sentencing in a noncapital case. see united states v. lafleur , 971 f.2d 200, 211-12 (9th cir.1991), cert. denied , u.s. , 113 s.ct. 1292 , 122 l.ed.2d 683 (1993). indeed, \"\"the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative.\"\" woodson v. north carolina , 428 u.s. 280, 304 , 96 s.ct. 2978, 2991 , 49 l.ed.2d 944 (1976). as justice kennedy has noted, as a general matter, the responsibility for fixing prison terms is properly within the province of legislatures, not courts. see harmelin , 501 u.s. at 998 , 111 s.ct. at 2703 (kennedy, j., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). because scrivner had no constitutional right to an individualized sentence, no constitutional error occurred when the trial court denied scrivner's motion for a continuance to prepare mitigating evidence for presentation at sentencing. indeed, the trial court did permit scrivner and his counsel to speak at sentencing, see roa vol. ii, trial tr. at 323-25. v scrivner argues the state court lacked jurisdiction over him because he is of native american ancestry and because the offenses were committed on the reservation. the state habeas court held an evidentiary hearing on this issue and concluded scrivner was \"\"not an indian within the meaning of 18 u.s.c. 1153, the major crimes act.\"\" roa vol. i, tab 12, ex. o at 4. it is true that the determination of whether a defendant is subject to 1153 is one of federal law. see united states v. antelope , 430 u.s. 641, 646 n. 7, 97 s.ct. 1395, 1399 n. 7, 51 l.ed.2d 701 (1977) ( 1153 federal criminal jurisdiction applies to enrolled members of tribes whose official status has not been terminated by congressional enactment and who committed crimes within the confines of indian country). for a criminal defendant to be subject to 1153, the court must make factual findings that the defendant \"\"(1) has some indian blood; and (2) is 'recognized' as an indian by a tribe or by the federal government.\"\" united states v. lawrence , 51 f.3d 150, 152 (8th cir.1995) (citing united states v. rogers , 45 u.s. (4 how.) 567, 572-73 , 11 l.ed. 1105 (1846)); cf. united states v. torres , 733 f.2d 449, 456 (7th cir.) (jury instructed as to facts it must find before holding defendant was native american), cert. denied , 469 u.s. 864 , 105 s.ct. 204 , 83 l.ed.2d 135 (1984). while we review the district court's application of the facts to the law de novo , lawrence , 51 f.3d at 152 , as previously noted, \"\"[u]nder 28 u.s.c. 2254(d), state-court findings of fact 'shall be presumed to be correct' in a federal habeas corpus proceeding \"\" miller v. fenton , 474 u.s. 104, 105 , 106 s.ct. 445, 447 , 88 l.ed.2d 405 (1985) (quoting 2254(d)). upon review of the record tapes of the habeas evidentiary hearing, we conclude scrivner had a full and fair hearing before the state court and the state court's findings are supported by the record in accord with 2254. because scrivner was found not to be a native american, the state court had jurisdiction to try him. vi scrivner next argues the state court lacked jurisdiction to try him because new mexico authorities arrested him in arizona without a warrant. scrivner waived extradition to new mexico after he was \"\"rearrested\"\" by arizona authorities. however, even if scrivner had not waived extradition, no constitutional error would be present. \"\"an illegal arrest, without more, has never been viewed as a bar to subsequent prosecution, nor as a defense to a valid conviction.\"\" united states v. crews , 445 u.s. 463, 474 , 100 s.ct. 1244, 1251 , 63 l.ed.2d 537 (1980); see also frisbie v. collins , 342 u.s. 519, 522 , 72 s.ct. 509, 511-12 , 96 l.ed. 541 (1952) (court's power to try a person for a crime is not impaired because he was forcibly brought into court's jurisdiction); cf. united states v. alvarez-machain , 504 u.s. 655, 669-70 , 112 s.ct. 2188, 2196-97 , 119 l.ed.2d 441 (1992) (fact that defendant was abducted to united states from another nation does not prohibit his trial in united states for violations of united states criminal laws when extradition treaty was not violated by abduction). due process is satisfied when a defendant is convicted \"\"after having been fairly apprized of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.\"\" frisbie , 342 u.s. at 522 , 72 s.ct. at 512 . the constitution does not require a court to permit a properly convicted defendant to escape justice solely \"\"because he was brought to trial against his will.\"\" id. vii next, scrivner argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel did not raise the jurisdictional issue of his native american heritage to the trial court. to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must show both \"\"that counsel's performance was deficient\"\" and \"\"that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"\" strickland v. washington , 466 u.s. 668, 687 , 104 s.ct. 2052, 2064 , 80 l.ed.2d 674 (1984). we have already noted that a full and fair hearing on scrivner's alleged status as a native american resulted in a ruling against his claim. that being the case, we cannot see how counsel's alleged deficiency of not raising that issue earlier could prejudice scrivner. thus, the ineffectiveness claim on this point fails. viii finally, scrivner argues the federal district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his due process rights were violated when the state trial court denied his request for a continuance of the sentencing hearing. if no facts are disputed and the issues can be resolved on the basis of the record and the law, no evidentiary hearing is required. see steele v. young , 11 f.3d 1518, 1524 (10th cir.1993). even if disputed issues of fact are raised, a habeas petitioner is entitled to a hearing in federal court only if he \"\"'did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding'\"\" which resulted in reliable findings. coleman v. saffle , 912 f.2d 1217, 1230 (10th cir.) (quoting townsend v. sain , 372 u.s. 293, 312 , 83 s.ct. 745, 756-57 , 9 l.ed.2d 770 (1963), overruled in part , keeney v. tamayo-reyes , 504 u.s. 1, 5 , 112 s.ct. 1715, 1717-18 , 118 l.ed.2d 318

federal \"\"three strikes\"\" statute. we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 18 u.s.c. 3742 and 28 u.s.c. 1291 , and affirm. i. a federal grand jury indicted defendant on, inter alia, one count of aggravated bank robbery in violation of 18 u.s.c. 2113(a) and (d). the government filed an information and asked the court to consider defendant's prior violent felony convictions at sentencing if he was convicted of bank robbery. defendant's criminal record included two prior convictions under 2113 and two prior state robbery convictions. a jury found defendant guilty of all charges. at defendant's sentencing hearing, the government presented documentary and testimonial evidence regarding three of defendant's prior convictions. defendant moved for a continuance to gather his own evidence, and the court granted the motion. at a renewed hearing several months later, defendant produced the affidavit of a former co-defendant stating that defendant was not present during the crime underlying one of his prior convictions. defendant contested his other prior convictions, but did not offer any evidence disputing them. the court found the affidavit unpersuasive and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment pursuant to 18 u.s.c. 3559(c) . ii. \"\"we review de novo a sentence enhancement imposed pursuant to section 3559(c) .\"\" united states v. romero , 122 f.3d 1334, 1342 (10th cir.1997). we review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute under the same standard. united states v. hampshire , 95 f.3d 999, 1001 (10th cir.1996). under 3559(c) , a district court must sentence a defendant to life imprisonment if he or she (1) is convicted in federal court of a \"\"serious violent felony\"\" and (2) has been convicted on separate prior occasions of two or more serious violent felonies in federal or state court. 18 u.s.c. 3559(c)(1)(a) . robbery, as defined in 18 u.s.c. 2113 , generally qualifies as a serious violent felony. 18 u.s.c. 3559(c)(2)(f)(i) . however, 3559 treats robbery as a non-qualifying felony id . 3559(c)(3) (a). in this case, the district court sentenced defendant to life in prison under 3559 based on his instant bank robbery conviction and his prior violent felony convictions. on appeal, defendant contends that 3559(c)(2) (f) violates his right to due process by failing to place an adequate burden of proof upon the government. 1 he also contends that 3559(c)(3) (a) violates due process because it requires him to establish by clear and convincing evidence that his prior convictions are non-qualifying felonies. a. defendant maintains that the government should be required to establish his prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. that contention is foreclosed by our decision in united states v. oberle , 136 f.3d 1414 (10th cir.), cert. denied , 525 u.s. 885 , 119 s.ct. 197 , 142 l.ed.2d 161 (1998). in oberle , we expressly declined to hold the government to such a high standard of proof under 3559(c) . id. at 1424 . instead, we held that the government satisfied its burden when it introduced certified copies of the defendant's four previous convictions and the defendant offered no contradictory proof. id. here, the government introduced documentary and testimonial evidence of three of defendant's prior convictions. thus, the government fulfilled its burden under 3559(c) of proving that defendant had at least two prior serious violent felony convictions. defendant correctly observes that a heightened burden of proof might be appropriate in cases of extraordinary upward adjustments in sentences. see united states v. watts , 519 u.s. 148, 156 , 117 s.ct. 633 , 136 l.ed.2d 554 (1997) (\"\"acknowledg[ing] a divergence of opinion among the circuits as to whether, in extreme circumstances, relevant conduct that would dramatically increase the sentence must be based on clear and convincing evidence\"\"). at the time of his sentencing, defendant was 42 years old and would have been subject to a sentencing range of approximately 27 to 32 years even without his three strikes enhancement. the enhancement therefore was not substantial enough to qualify as dramatic or extreme. see united states v. segien , 114 f.3d 1014, 1019-20 (10th cir.1997) (upholding a threefold sentencing enhancement and cataloging cases in which sentences were greatly enhanced after prior offenses were proved by a preponderance of the evidence); united states v. washington , 11 f.3d 1510, 1516 (10th cir.1993) (upholding application of the preponderance standard in the enhancement of a sentence from twenty years to consecutive forty-year terms). b. defendant also contends that 3559(c)(3) (a) violates due process by shifting to him the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that he qualifies for exemption from the three strikes sentencing enhancement. he argues first that the statute's burden-shifting scheme itself is unconstitutional. second, he claims that the burden of proof demanded by 3559(c)(3) (a) is too high. section 3559(c) is a sentencing enhancement statute. oberle , 136 f.3d at 1424 . the supreme court has recognized that sentencing and trial are distinct judicial phases in which different processes are due. see watts , 519 u.s. at 155 , 117 s.ct. 633 (noting that different standards of proof govern at trial and sentencing); nichols v. united states , 511 u.s. 738, 747 , 114 s.ct. 1921 , 128 l.ed.2d 745 (1994) (recognizing that the sentencing process is \"\"less exacting than the process of establishing guilt\"\"). thus, due process requires only that a court sentence defendant in proceedings that are fundamentally fair. see parke v. raley , 506 u.s. 20, 34 , 113 s.ct. 517 , 121 l.ed.2d 391 (1992) (concluding that a burden-shifting sentencing statute was not fundamentally unfair and therefore did not violate due process); united states v. wicks , 132 f.3d 383, 388 (7th cir.1997) (\"\"[t]he [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause requires only that [sentencing] proceedings be fundamentally fair \"\"). in parke , the supreme court held that kentucky's persistent felony offender sentencing statute, a burden-shifting rule similar to 3559(c)(1) (a), \"\"easily passes constitutional muster.\"\" 506 u.s. at 28 , 113 s.ct. 517 . kentucky's law provided mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons. id. at 22 , 113 s.ct. 517 . under the statute, defendants could challenge their prior convictions, id. , but bore the ultimate burden of proving those convictions invalid, id. at 31 , 113 s.ct. 517 . the court held that \"\"even when a collateral attack on a final conviction rests on constitutional grounds, the presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments makes it appropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant.\"\" id. furthermore, it is clear that the legislative branch may constitutionally allocate the burden of proving an affirmative defense to the defendant. patterson v. new york , 432 u.s. 197, 207-08, 210 , 97 s.ct. 2319 , 53 l.ed.2d 281 (1977). \"\"if patterson allows such a result even at the stage of the trial where guilt or innocence is decided, it follows that due process does not prohibit the kind of affirmative defense at the sentencing stage found in 3559(c)(3) (a).\"\" wicks , 132 f.3d at 389 (rejecting a due process challenge to the three strikes law). under parke , patterson and wicks , we hold that the burden shifting scheme found in 3559(c)(3) (a) does not violate due process. we need not reach defendant's challenge to the weight of 3559(c)(3) (a)'s proof burden. under any standard of proof, defendant cannot establish that he is exempt from the three strikes enhancement. the government introduced evidence of three prior convictions. defendant produced evidence which, if believed, would call into question only one of these prior convictions. 2 thus, defendant had three strikes even if the district court did not count the contested conviction. in light of this, we will not proceed further. united states v. kaluna , 192 f.3d 1188, 1196-98 (9th cir.1999) (en banc) (declining to reach the defendant's challenge to the burden of proof demanded by 3559(c)(3) (a) because the defendant would lose under any standard of proof), cert. denied , u.s. , 120 s.ct. 1561 , 146 l.ed.2d 465 (2000). appellant's third motion to supplement the record and to withdraw the second motion to supplement the record is g
